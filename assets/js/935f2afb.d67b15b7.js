We will also show you how to work lazily with big data on Arkitekt, and how to associate metadata with your data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developers/python/classical/Usage":{"id":"developers/python/classical/Usage","title":"Usage","description":"Design","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developers/python/graphql":{"id":"developers/python/graphql","title":"Developing with GraphQL","description":"As stated in the API section, the GraphQL API is the primary way to interact with the platform.

This can range from just checking that the acquisition is running properly (e.g., no loss of focus or some illumination problem), to monitoring the evolution of live biological samples (e.g., premature cell death). Classically, images are batch-processed once the acquisition is complete, i.e., when all of the data have been fully acquired and stored, leaving no chance for real-time analysis and feedback. In this second workflow, we illustrate how Arkitekt with its ability for streaming analysis (i.e., processing immediately after each acquisition event), enables to display real-time feedback on the running acquisition.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"troubleshooting/app":{"id":"troubleshooting/app","title":"Help!
