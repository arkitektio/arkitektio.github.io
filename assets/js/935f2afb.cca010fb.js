do we call your app.","description":"Arkitekt is a platform that enables you to connect your favourite tools together. To do this, Arkitekt needs to know how to call your app. Arkitekt uses a simple protocol called Arkitekt RPC to call your app. Arkitekt RPC is a simple but powerful protocol that allows Arkitekt to call your app, and for your app to call Arkitekt. Arkitekt RPC is very much alike other RPC protocols, but extends their concepts to allow for a more client-side oriented approach.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design/middleman":{"id":"design/middleman","title":"Arkitekt the Middleman","description":"Bioimage analysis has been around for a long time, and has been a very active field of research for the past 20 years.

Without these Apps arkitekt would be just a (reasonably cool) storage platform with a developer interface. Apps ( in the Arkitekt sense) connect to arkitekt and provide the functionality that makes Arkitekt useful (like applying filters to images) and give you the ability to interact with the data that you store in Arkitekt. As such, the definition of an arkitekt App is a bit broaders, than what you might think of as an App (especially if you are used to the App Store on your phone). This section will introduce you to the concept of an App in Arkitekt, and will give you a few examples of what an App can be.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design/terminology/node":{"id":"design/terminology/node","title":"What is a Node?","description":"What is a node?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design/terminology/tasks":{"id":"design/terminology/tasks","title":"How do these elements relate?","description":"One of the core functionality of Arkitekt is to assign different apps some","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design/terminology/template":{"id":"design/terminology/template","title":"What is a Template?","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design/terminology/why":{"id":"design/terminology/why","title":"Why new words?","description":"While developing Arkitekt, we have found ourselves in the position of having to explain the same concepts over and over again.

So we decided to create a list of terms that we use in Arkitekt, and explain them in a way that we hope is easy to understand. If you are new to Arkitekt, we recommend that you take a look at this list before you start reading the rest of the documentation, as they will help you understand the rest of the documentation better, and guide you in the right direction.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"design/terminology/workflow":{"id":"design/terminology/workflow","title":"Workflow","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developers/contribute/intro":{"id":"developers/contribute/intro","title":"Contribution","description":"So you would like to contribute to the Arkitekt development.
