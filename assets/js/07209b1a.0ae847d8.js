Well, its actually not that different from the standard workflow setting. As Arkitekt workflows are just blueprints,\nthat are schedule by an app, we can just instruct the scheduling app to schedule tasks on nodes that are locally available, directly in memory, instead of\nrequesting Arkitekt to schedule the tasks for us. This enables us to assing tasks to nodes that are locally available, with minimal/zero latency and only\nresort to Arkitekt when we need to call functionality that is not available locally. But what about the data? First, all data that is send from app to app\nneeds to still be stored centrally on the Arkitekt server, so that apps can easily interchange and share data. However, as Node can define arbitary Inputs and Outputs,\nwe can define Inputs and Outputs that are not stored centrally, but that are kept local to the node. These Input and output Structures are termed ",(0,s.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"locally scoped"),', which means\nthat Arkitekt will make sure that you can only wire up nodes that have the same local scope, in the workflow. To now perform a single or series of workflow task locally, we can just convert\nthe data that is stored centrally to a locally scoped data structure (a tasks done by a "BRIDGE" node), send it to a node that has locally scoped inputs and then consequentlly\nconvert the locally scoped output back to a centrally stored (global scoped) data structure (again done by a "BRIDGE" node).'),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"This is best illustrated with the example of how we\nuse that in Fiji."),(0,s.kt)("h3",{id:"our-workflow"},"Our workflow"),(0,s.kt)("p",null,"Fiji is a popular image processing app, that is used by many in the scientific community.
