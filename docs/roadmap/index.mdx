# Arkitekt Next

Developing the Arkitekt Platform is an ongoing process. While we are happy with the current version of Arkitekt, we are always looking for ways to
improve the platform and make it more user-friendly, stable, and reliable. After having adapted the platform to a set of applications, we have now 
learned a lot more about the needs of users and are working on a lessons-learned-version of Arkitekt that will address the most dire pitfalls of the current version.
of Arkitekt.

:::note Important Note

We are working tirelessly to bring the next version of Arkitekt to you. Currently we are stepping into a pre-alpha phase and are looking for early adopters
that want to help us test the new version of Arkitekt. If you are interested in testing the new version of Arkitekt, please go ahead and check out
the installation instructions for the `next` version of Arkitekt. Rest assured that the "paper version", will remain available and rest frozen in time
to ensure reproducability of the paper.

# Main New Features and Improvements

Here are some of the main new features and improvements that we are working on for the next version of Arkitekt:

## Improved User Experience

We are working on improving the user experience of Arkitekt. While Orkestrator is a powerful tool, we are realizing that it can be overwhelming for new users. 
Our next version will have a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Here we are focusing on the following areas:

### Improved Design and Layout

The design and layout of "Orkestrator" boasts a lot of features and functionality, but it is not very user-friendly.
With the new interface we are working on, we are aiming to make the platform more user-friendly and intuitive, streamlining
the UI and UX.

  controls
  className="rounded rounded-md"
  width={"100%"}
>
  <source src={ui} />
</video>

:::note Note
The new design of Orkestrator has still no feature parity with the old version. We are working on adding all the features of the old version
to the new version, but we are also taking the opportunity to rework some of the features that are not as intuitive as we would like them to be.
:::


### No more Reservations

While Johannes was desperately trying to make reservations work, we realized that the concept of "reserving" a node was not very
intuitive and was causing a lot of confusion (additionally it was a source of many bugs). So we got rid of it ! The new version of Arkitekt
will allow you to assign tasks to nodes directly without having to reserve them first. But hey don't worry they are not gone entirely
and reservations will still be used to predefine the parameters for batch-tasks to make them both more easy to start and more efficient.
You just don't have to think about them to much:

Look how easy it is to start a task:

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  controls
  className="rounded rounded-md"
  width={"100%"}
>
  <source src={assignment} />
</video>

The menu you are seeing here is subject to change, but the general idea is that you can start a task with a single click. Additionally 
take note of the new "Installable Actions" section. This is a new feature that will allow you to install actions that are not part of your
instance but might be useful for your workflow. (i.e. you might want to install a "Segmentation" action that is not part of your instance yet)
But thats (not so distant) "future music" and we are still working on the details of this feature.


### Improved Workflow Design  

Visual Workflow Design in Orkestrator is currently a bit complex and not very intuitive. We have reworked and are continuing to iterate on the workflow design and making it more intuitive.
The new prototype alreadly includes features such as auto node suggestion, auto-repair of broken workflows, and more and uses design patterns
that users are already familiar with from other workflow design tools like Blender or Unreal Engine. Here is a sneak peak of the new design:

<video

  controls
  className="rounded rounded-md"

  <source src={workflow} />
</video>

We really hope that this new design will make it easier for users to create and manage their workflows in Orkestrator. However if you have any feedback
on the new design, please feel free to reach out to us on [GitHub](https://github.com/arkitektio)

## Improved Data management

### Introducing the Knowledge Graph

A vision of Arkitekt was to capture the reality of biological systems in a database that allows users to create arbitraty measurements
and interactively link them to each other. But the current version of Arkitekt does not fully allow to capture the intricacies of biological
interactions intuitevely. The next version of Arkitekt will introduce the "Knowledge Graph" a new feature that will allow users to assign 
meaning to their analyzed data (e.g. this ROI delineates an Axon) and link them to other data (e.g. this Axon is connected to this Dendrite).
For this Arkitekt will now feature a Graph Database (based on the amazing Apache AGE project) that will allow users to interactively create
and explore the relationships between their data using their own vocabulary.

  className="rounded rounded-md"

  <source src={knowledge} />
</video>

:::note 
This is a prelimnary version of the Knowledge Graph and we are working on improving the user experience and the features of the Knowledge Graph.
We would like to tightly integrate the Knowledge Graph with the Views and Protocols features of the next version of Arkitekt.
:::

Of course this changes the way you interact with your data. Instead of just having a list of images, you now have a graph of knowledge entities
that are linked to each other. This is a powerful feature that allows you to capture the intricacies of your data in a more intuitive way. You might
have noticed in the previous video that ROIs can have these entities attached to them. Like this you can describe your data in a more flexible way

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  controls
  className="rounded rounded-md"
  width={"100%"}
>
  <source src={graph} />
</video>

Of course you can also attach various metrics to your data. Want to attach a "length" metric to your AIS? Just create a new metric expression
and attach it to your AIS through for example a ROI Length Measurement? (We will describe that better in the upcoming documentation)

<div className="mt-2 p-6">
<Image img={graphd} />

<div className="text-gray-400 mb-2">
<small>
The new data and metadata model now includes the knowledge graph which brings features from graph-databases to the platform.
Here you can see the new model applied to the old "paper" example of an interactive workflow. Once Arkitet Next is released we will
reimaging this workllow in the new system.
(Its still postgres under the hood)

### Introducing Views
Metadata management is a major pain point in the bioimage community. To often does the metadata get lost or is not properly documented, and
often because the metadata system is to rigid to accomodate the needs of the users. The next version of Arkitekt will introduce the concept of
"Views". Views are ways to describe the metadata of your data in a flexible way emphasizing the multi-dimensionality of images.

Your first channel of the image is supposed to be displayed in a certain color? Just add a `RGBView` to only that channel. 
You want to describe the acquisition parameters of your entire image? Add a `AcquisitionView` to the whole image
You want to indicate that this images pixel values represent labels (in a segmentation Map), just add a `PixelView` to the image, and
map the labels to your Knowledge Entities. While your image-data might never change, the way you describe it can be as flexible as you need it to be.

:::note Note

A better of this feature is comming soon. We are working on improving the user experience and the features of the Views feature.

:::

### Introduction of Protocols

Protocols are a way to describe the steps of sample preparation, image acquisition, and image analysis in a structured way, and to link specific protocol-steps
to your image data. Imaging you want to filter  all your images based on which  a specific antibody was used in the primary staining? If you added the antibody to the
protocol, and you can now filter your images (attached via ProtocolViews) based on that information. 

:::note note

The usability of this feature is still in development. We are working on improving the user experience and the features of the Protocols feature.
As we don't want you to write a protocol for every image, we are working on optimizing the procedure to attach protocols to your data.

:::

# Stability

Stability is a major focus of the development on Arkitekt Next. As the platform grew organically out of our research needs,
some parts of the platform are not as stable as we would like them to be. We are working on improving the stability of the platform
and making sure that it is robust and reliable. Here we are focusing on the following areas:

### Adressing Dependency Hell

One of the arguabily biggest features of the Arkitekt platform is its ability to have applications run code that depend on other
applications. May it be that you schedule a workflow on one app, that calls a plugin on another app. Or when when you have written
a plugin that internally calls another plugin.

This is a powerful feature, but our current implementation is not as stable as we would like it to be. Especially when apps fail, and
we have to cascade the failure to other apps that depend on the failed app. Currently propagating this change to the next app needs is
handled on the client side, and is therefore not as reliable as we would like it to be. The next version of Arkitekt will adress this
feature and make sure that the platform is more robust by introducing the "Dependency Graph".

#### Dependency Graph

The Dependency Graph is a new feature that represents a major overhaul of the rekuest service, and will require application developers
to define the dependencies of their applications in a more explicit way. Through this the rekuest service will be able to construct a
graph of dependencies between applications and will be able to handle cascading failures in a more reliable way.

```python title="The old way"
from arkitekt import register
from arkitekt import find

@register
def my_function_that_needs_another_function():
    # This is how you would call another function in the current version of Arkitekt
    # This is not very reliable as the client has to handle the failure of the other function
    # and propagate the failure to the next function
    try:
        dependend_function = find("other_function")
    except:
        raise Exception("The function is not registered with the platform. This error is annoying for users")
    
    dependend_function()

```

```python title="The new way"
from arkitekt import register, declare

dependend_function = declare("other_function")

@register(dependencies=[dependend_function])
def my_function_that_needs_another_function():
    # This is how you would call another function in the next version of Arkitekt
    # This is more reliabe as the rekuest service will not allow assignments to this
    # function if the other function is not available
    dependend_function()

```

:::note Note

The `declare` function will always allow for users to declare dependencies on `Nodes` *not* on `Implementations`. You can
however `narrow` the dependency to a specific implementation by providing additional parameters to the `declare` function.
i.e `dependend_function = declare("other_function", strategy="TEST")` will return all currently available implementations of the
Node `other_function` and make them available for testing.

:::

:::note `declare` vs `reserve`

Declaration and reserving are tigthly linked concepts but are not the same. Declarions of dependencies are done on the `Implementation`
level and will only result in the reservation of that specific node once this `Implementation` is provisioned. The narrowing parameter
are therefore similar to the reserve patterns.

:::

### Adressing the fragility of Client-Server relationships

Arkitekt is buld around the concept of apps that want to connect to the platform. But this platform is
by design modular as we wanted to make it easy for sys admins to only choose the modules they need. Do not
care about `mikro`? Just don't install it. `Kluster` is exactly what you want because you have a cluster? Just
add it in your `docker-compose` file.

So how do we make sure that the apps can find services that they need to connect to? The Arkitekt answer to this 
is "Fakts", a small protocol that we developed for the service discovery inside Arkitekt. And it does work great 
for its intended purpose. However while transitioning from the `Paper` version to the `Next` version we realized that
apps do not really have a way of declaring specific version requirements and communicate them before they are 
installed. This is a major issue as it can lead to the installation of apps that are not compatible with your
underlying services.

#### Extension to Fakts and Manifest

The next version of Arkitekt will introduce elaborate on the concept of the `Manifest` and Fakts will more tigthly
integrate and inspect the manifest of an app before it is installed. This will allow for the platform to make sure
that the app is compatible with the services that are available on the platform.

While before the manifest was a simple yaml file that was used to describe the app, the next version of Arkitekt will
require the manifest to be more explicit about the dependencies of the app. This will allow the platform to make sure
that the app is compatible with the services that are available on the platform.


```yaml title="The old manifest"
name: "My App"
version: "1.0.0"
```


```yaml title="The new way"
name: "My App"
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
    - kluster: "live.arkitekt.kluster@paper"
    - mikro: "live.arkitekt.mikro@paper"
    - rekuest: "live.arkitekt.rekuest@next"
```

Here the app declares that it needs the `kluster` and `mikro` services in the `paper` version and the `rekuest` service in the `next` version.
When the app is installed, the platform will check if the services are available and if they are compatible with the app. If not, the installation
will fail preemptively.

:::note Note

The `dependencies` field in the manifest can be a list of services that the app needs to connect to. However it can also be used to get access to 
specific configuration values that are configurable by the user. i.e 

```yaml
name: "My App"
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
    - kluster: "live.arkitekt.kluster@paper"
    - should_use_gpu: "config.gpu_enabled"

```

Would allow the app to get access to the `gpu_enabled` configuration value that can be set by an admin in the platform configuration, and
tight to that specific app. This is a powerful feature that allows for a more fine grained control of the app configuration.

:::

This is a powerful feature but also a source of many bugs. We are working on improving the way dependencies are handled

#### Improved Documentation

We are working on improving the documentation of Arkitekt. While the current documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming for new users. 
While we will keep the expert section we will also add a new section for beginners and intermediate users.

#### Improved Backend Stack 

We are working on improving the backend stack of Arkitekt. Currently Arkitekt is built on top of a stack of Graphene, Django, and Postgres. While We are happy with the two latter, `Graphene` has some limitations
and we are going to replace `Strawberry` which is a new GraphQL library that provides a more type safe and intuitive API. This stack is already powering newer services such as `Kabinet` and `Mikro Next` 
and we are happy with the results.

#### Performance Updates

A major focus of the development on Rekuest will be on improving the performance of the platform, when assigning tasks. While the current version of Arkitekt is not slow by any means, we are working
of scqueezing out every bit of performance from the platform, when it comes to distributed task assignment.

#### Improved API Design

We are working on improving the API design of Arkitekt. While the current API is powerful, it does not follow all the best practices. THe next version of Arkitekt will have a more consistent and intuitive API
based on the `GraphQL` best practices.

#### Improved Security

We are working on improving the security of Arkitekt. While currently Arkitekt is `secure by design`, most security features are not `enforced`. 
The next version of Arkitekt will have more security features that are `enforced` by default.import knowledge from "./knowledge.mp4";
