# Arkitekt Next

Developing the Arkitekt Platform is an ongoing process. We are constantly working on improving the platform and adding new features.
Based on our versioning [Schema](docs/design/version), most of our new features and improvements are currently part of `Arkitekt Next`.

:::note Important Note

We are working tirelessly to bring the next version of Arkitekt to you. Rest assured, we are also maintaining the current version of Arkitekt and are providing regular updates and security patches.
Also all changes and improvements are being made in a way that SHOULD be backward compatible with the current version of Arkitekt.

:::

## What is coming next?

We are currently working on the following features and improvements and much more:

#### Improved User Experience

We are working on improving the user experience of Arkitekt. While Orkestrator is a powerful tool, we are realizing that it can be overwhelming for new users. 
Our next version will have a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Here we are focusing on the following areas:

- **Improved Design and Layout**:  We are working on a new design and layout for "Orkestrator" and are streamlining
the process of "reserving" Nodes and "deploying" applications.

- **Improved Workflow Design**:  Visual Workflow Design in Orkestrator is currently a bit complex and not very intuitive. We are working on improving the workflow design and making it more intuitive.
The new prototype alreadly includes features such as auto node suggestion, auto-repair of broken workflows, and more.



#### Improved Documentation

We are working on improving the documentation of Arkitekt. While the current documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming for new users. 
While we will keep the expert section we will also add a new section for beginners and intermediate users.

#### Improved Backend Stack 

We are working on improving the backend stack of Arkitekt. Currently Arkitekt is built on top of a stack of Graphene, Django, and Postgres. While We are happy with the two latter, `Graphene` has some limitations
and we are going to replace `Strawberry` which is a new GraphQL library that provides a more type safe and intuitive API. This stack is already powering newer services such as `Kabinet` and `Mikro Next` 
and we are happy with the results.

#### Performance Updates

A major focus of the development on Rekuest will be on improving the performance of the platform, when assigning tasks. While the current version of Arkitekt is not slow by any means, we are working
of scqueezing out every bit of performance from the platform, when it comes to distributed task assignment.

#### Improved API Design

We are working on improving the API design of Arkitekt. While the current API is powerful, it does not follow all the best practices. THe next version of Arkitekt will have a more consistent and intuitive API
based on the `GraphQL` best practices.

#### Improved Security

We are working on improving the security of Arkitekt. While currently Arkitekt is `secure by design`, most security features are not `enforced`. 
The next version of Arkitekt will have more security features that are `enforced` by default.
