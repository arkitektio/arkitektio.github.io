# Arkitekt Next

Developing the Arkitekt Platform is an ongoing process. We are constantly working on improving the platform and adding new features.
Based on our versioning [Schema](/docs/design/version), most of our new features and improvements are currently part of `Arkitekt Next`.

:::note Important Note

We are working tirelessly to bring the next version of Arkitekt to you. Rest assured, we are also maintaining the current version of Arkitekt
and will continue to provide support and updates for it until we are ready to release the next version.
All changes and improvements are being made in a way that SHOULD be backward compatible with the current version of Arkitekt.

:::

#### What is coming next?

Arkitekt Next is our way of addressing the **lessons we have learned** from the current version of Arkitekt and **feedback from our users**.
The Paper version of Arkitekt will remain available and rest frozen in time (to ensure reproducability of the paper), 
while we continue to develop the Next version.

#### Main New Features and Improvements

Arkitekt Next focusses primarily on stability and usability improvements. It does not aim to bring a whole new battery of
features but rather should be seen as **refinement** of the existing platform, and its underlying technologies. 

# Improved User Experience

We are working on improving the user experience of Arkitekt. While Orkestrator is a powerful tool, we are realizing that it can be overwhelming for new users. 
Our next version will have a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. Here we are focusing on the following areas:

### Improved Design and Layout

We are working on a new design and layout for "Orkestrator" and are streamlining
the process of "reserving" Nodes and "deploying" applications. The new design will be more intuitive and user-friendly.
Our goal is to not only make the platform more user-friendly but also to make it more visually appealing.
For this we have adopted a new design language that is more modern and visually appealing based on shadcn-ui.


### Improved Workflow Design  

Visual Workflow Design in Orkestrator is currently a bit complex and not very intuitive. We are working on improving the workflow design and making it more intuitive.
The new prototype alreadly includes features such as auto node suggestion, auto-repair of broken workflows, and more and uses design patterns
that users are already familiar with from other workflow design tools like Blender or Unreal Engine. Here is a sneak peak of the new design:

# Stability

Stability is a major focus of the development on Arkitekt Next. As the platform grew organically out of our research needs,
some parts of the platform are not as stable as we would like them to be. We are working on improving the stability of the platform
and making sure that it is robust and reliable. Here we are focusing on the following areas:

### Adressing Dependency Hell

One of the arguabily biggest features of the Arkitekt platform is its ability to have applications run code that depend on other
applications. May it be that you schedule a workflow on one app, that calls a plugin on another app. Or when when you have written
a plugin that internally calls another plugin.

This is a powerful feature, but our current implementation is not as stable as we would like it to be. Especially when apps fail, and
we have to cascade the failure to other apps that depend on the failed app. Currently propagating this change to the next app needs is
handled on the client side, and is therefore not as reliable as we would like it to be. The next version of Arkitekt will adress this
feature and make sure that the platform is more robust by introducing the "Dependency Graph".

#### Dependency Graph

The Dependency Graph is a new feature that represents a major overhaul of the rekuest service, and will require application developers
to define the dependencies of their applications in a more explicit way. Through this the rekuest service will be able to construct a
graph of dependencies between applications and will be able to handle cascading failures in a more reliable way.

```python title="The old way"
from arkitekt import register
from arkitekt import find

@register
def my_function_that_needs_another_function():
    # This is how you would call another function in the current version of Arkitekt
    # This is not very reliable as the client has to handle the failure of the other function
    # and propagate the failure to the next function
    try:
        dependend_function = find("other_function")
    except:
        raise Exception("The function is not registered with the platform. This error is annoying for users")
    
    dependend_function()

```

```python title="The new way"
from arkitekt import register, declare

dependend_function = declare("other_function")

@register(dependencies=[dependend_function])
def my_function_that_needs_another_function():
    # This is how you would call another function in the next version of Arkitekt
    # This is more reliabe as the rekuest service will not allow assignments to this
    # function if the other function is not available
    dependend_function()

```

:::note Note

The `declare` function will always allow for users to declare dependencies on `Nodes` *not* on `Implementations`. You can
however `narrow` the dependency to a specific implementation by providing additional parameters to the `declare` function.
i.e `dependend_function = declare("other_function", strategy="TEST")` will return all currently available implementations of the
Node `other_function` and make them available for testing.

:::

:::note `declare` vs `reserve`

Declaration and reserving are tigthly linked concepts but are not the same. Declarions of dependencies are done on the `Implementation`
level and will only result in the reservation of that specific node once this `Implementation` is provisioned. The narrowing parameter
are therefore similar to the reserve patterns.

:::

### Adressing the fragility of Client-Server relationships

Arkitekt is buld around the concept of apps that want to connect to the platform. But this platform is
by design modular as we wanted to make it easy for sys admins to only choose the modules they need. Do not
care about `mikro`? Just don't install it. `Kluster` is exactly what you want because you have a cluster? Just
add it in your `docker-compose` file.

So how do we make sure that the apps can find services that they need to connect to? The Arkitekt answer to this 
is "Fakts", a small protocol that we developed for the service discovery inside Arkitekt. And it does work great 
for its intended purpose. However while transitioning from the `Paper` version to the `Next` version we realized that
apps do not really have a way of declaring specific version requirements and communicate them before they are 
installed. This is a major issue as it can lead to the installation of apps that are not compatible with your
underlying services.

#### Extension to Fakts and Manifest

The next version of Arkitekt will introduce elaborate on the concept of the `Manifest` and Fakts will more tigthly
integrate and inspect the manifest of an app before it is installed. This will allow for the platform to make sure
that the app is compatible with the services that are available on the platform.

While before the manifest was a simple yaml file that was used to describe the app, the next version of Arkitekt will
require the manifest to be more explicit about the dependencies of the app. This will allow the platform to make sure
that the app is compatible with the services that are available on the platform.


```yaml title="The old manifest"
name: "My App"
version: "1.0.0"
```


```yaml title="The new way"
name: "My App"
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
    - kluster: "live.arkitekt.kluster@paper"
    - mikro: "live.arkitekt.mikro@paper"
    - rekuest: "live.arkitekt.rekuest@next"
```

Here the app declares that it needs the `kluster` and `mikro` services in the `paper` version and the `rekuest` service in the `next` version.
When the app is installed, the platform will check if the services are available and if they are compatible with the app. If not, the installation
will fail preemptively.

:::note Note

The `dependencies` field in the manifest can be a list of services that the app needs to connect to. However it can also be used to get access to 
specific configuration values that are configurable by the user. i.e 

```yaml
name: "My App"
version: "1.0.0"
dependencies:
    - kluster: "live.arkitekt.kluster@paper"
    - should_use_gpu: "config.gpu_enabled"

```

Would allow the app to get access to the `gpu_enabled` configuration value that can be set by an admin in the platform configuration, and
tight to that specific app. This is a powerful feature that allows for a more fine grained control of the app configuration.

:::

This is a powerful feature but also a source of many bugs. We are working on improving the way dependencies are handled

#### Improved Documentation

We are working on improving the documentation of Arkitekt. While the current documentation is comprehensive, it can be overwhelming for new users. 
While we will keep the expert section we will also add a new section for beginners and intermediate users.

#### Improved Backend Stack 

We are working on improving the backend stack of Arkitekt. Currently Arkitekt is built on top of a stack of Graphene, Django, and Postgres. While We are happy with the two latter, `Graphene` has some limitations
and we are going to replace `Strawberry` which is a new GraphQL library that provides a more type safe and intuitive API. This stack is already powering newer services such as `Kabinet` and `Mikro Next` 
and we are happy with the results.

#### Performance Updates

A major focus of the development on Rekuest will be on improving the performance of the platform, when assigning tasks. While the current version of Arkitekt is not slow by any means, we are working
of scqueezing out every bit of performance from the platform, when it comes to distributed task assignment.

#### Improved API Design

We are working on improving the API design of Arkitekt. While the current API is powerful, it does not follow all the best practices. THe next version of Arkitekt will have a more consistent and intuitive API
based on the `GraphQL` best practices.

#### Improved Security

We are working on improving the security of Arkitekt. While currently Arkitekt is `secure by design`, most security features are not `enforced`. 
The next version of Arkitekt will have more security features that are `enforced` by default.
