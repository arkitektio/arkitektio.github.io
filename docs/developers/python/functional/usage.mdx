# Getting Started

So you installed arkitekt and now you want to start using it. This guide will help you get started.
This tutorial assumes you have a basic (really basic) understanding of the command line
and have arkitekt installed on your computer.

## Lets check things are setup correctly

Before we start, lets make sure that arkitekt is installed correctly. To do this, we will
run the following command.

<Terminal src={"/doks/casts/johannes.cast"} />

If you dont see the following output, then you need to go back and install arkitekt. If it still
doesnt work, then please check out our FAQ or open an issue and
we will help you get it working.

## Creating a new app

When utilizing arkitekt, you will be working with apps. An app is a collection of functionality
that you will be able to expose to your lab members.

For example, you might have an app thatallows your lab members to process images in various ways, or to analysis data in a particular
way.

Generally speaking, you will want to create a new folder and a new python project for each application
you create. This will make it easier to manage your apps and to keep them separate from each other.
It will also make it easier to deploy your apps to users in the future. For this tutorial, we will
create a new folder called `myapp` and then create a new arkitekt project inside of it.

<Terminal src={"/doks/casts/arkitekt-init.cast"} />

### What just happened?

When you run the `arkitekt init` command, arkitekt will ask you a few questions about your app and create
the ".arkitekt" folder inside your directory, which containers a manifest about your app.
and what they will be used for. The CLI will also create an app.py file for you, which will be the entrypoint
for your app.

### Why we need a manifest

The manifest is a file that contains information about your app. It contains information about your app,
such as its name, version, and entrypoint. It also contains information about how your app will be built
and deployed. The manifest is used by arkitekt to build and deploy your app. It is also used by the arkitekt
web interface to display information about your app and to allow users to run your app.

#### About your name

Well this is simple enough. Its just your name. When others will be using your app on your arkitekt they will
see your name associated with it, and might be able to contact you if they have questions about your app.

#### Your apps name

Arkitekt will ask you a few questions about your app. The first question is the name of your app.
This is the name that will be used to identify on the arkitekt web interface. The name _should_ be
unique, so if you are creating an app that is similar to an existing app by another user, you might have
problems of connecting your apps to the arkitekt web interface. If you are unsure, you can always

#### Your version

Also note that we will ask you for the current version of your app. The version can be used to track changes
in your code and your deployments. It is recommended that you use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
but we are not enforcing it. Versions are optional, but we recommend that you use them, especially if you plan
on deploying your app to users.

#### The entrypoint

The entrypoint is the file that will be used to start your app. This is the file that will contain all of your
functions that you want to register with arkitekt. The entrypoint file should **NOT** contain any code that is being
executed when the file is imported. This is because arkitekt will import your entrypoint file to register your
functions with the arkitekt web interface. If you have code that is being executed when the file is imported, it will
be executed every time a user runs your app (or you run in in dev mode). You can however have arbitary code inside
a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, which will only be executed when the file is run directly.

Ok:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print("Hello World") # will only be executed when the file is run directly
```

Not ok:

```python
print("Hello World") # will be executed every time the file is imported
```

#### The builder

The builders are functions that will create your arkitekt app. Through defining different builders, you can
highly customize how your app is being created, which services it will use and how it connects to your arkitekt instance
For example the `easy` builder provides you with a simple way to create a new user-bound app and
authenticate itthrough the arkitekt web interface, while the `port`, builder will try to find its configuration from environment variables,
that are by default set within port containers. You can read more about the different builders in the builders section.
As a default though you don't need to worry about this, and can just use the `easy` builder.
