# Building your Plugin

## Introduction

In this section, we will learn how to build an Arkitekt plugin from your python code. 
We will also learn how to package and distribute your plugin so that it can be discovered and
user by others.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have created your plugin and have it working in your local environment.
Also check if that plugin is working with your local Arkitekt instance.

## Packaging your Plugin

To package your plugin, you will need to create a software container around your python app, that will include
all the dependencies and the code. In a default configuration, Arkitekt uses Docker to build and run plugins.

### Start Building

To start building your plugin, you will have to initialize a `Flavour` for your project. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
arkitekt port init
```

This will ask you a few questions about your project and will create a new flavour in your project ".arkitekt" directory. The content of
this directory will look something like this:

```bash
.arkitekt
├── flavours
│   ├── default
│   │   ├── Dockerfile
│   │   ├── config.yaml
```

This is your first flavour. A flavour is a way of bundling your code and dependencies into a container. The `Dockerfile` is the file that
will be used to build the container. The `config.yaml` file is the configuration file for the flavour, and help the Arkitekt Server and
connected tools to understand if the build flavour fits the underlying hardware of the server.

:::note On Flavours

You can have multiple flavours in your project. Each flavour can be used to build a different version of your plugin.
For example, you can have a flavour that allows you to bundle your dockercontainer to support CUDA and another one that
supports only CPU. By specifiying the right `selectors` in your `config.yaml` file, you can make sure that the right Flavours
is used for the right hardware of the server that is running your plugin.

### The Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` is the file that will be used to build the container. It is a simple text file that contains a list of commands that
the Docker daemon will execute to build the container. Arkitekt has no specific requirements for the `Dockerfile`, besides that you need
to include the app.py and the .arkitekt folder in the container and that on execution it should be in the current working directory.

A simple `Dockerfile` for a python plugin could look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

````

This `Dockerfile` will create a container based on the `python:3.8-slim` image, and will install the requirements from the `requirements.txt` file
that is in the root of your project. It will also copy the rest of the files in the root of your project to the `/app` directory in the container.

:::note On Paths

The paths in the `Dockerfile` are relative to the root of your project. This means that you need to have a `requirements.txt` file in the root of your project,
not in the `.arkitekt` directory.

:::

### The config.yaml

The `config.yaml` file is the configuration file for the flavour. It contains a list of selectors that will be used to determine if the flavour
is compatible with the server that is running the plugin. The `config.yaml` file will look something like this:

```yaml
description: This is a vanilla flavour
dockerfile: Dockerfile
selectors: []
```

This file is empty by default. You can add selectors to the file to make sure that the flavour is only used on servers that have the right hardware
to run the container. For example, if you have a flavour that supports CUDA, you can add a selector that checks if the server has a GPU:

```yaml
description: This is a cuda flavour
dockerfile: Dockerfile
selectors:
  - type: cuda
    min_compute_capability: 3.5
```

This will make sure that the flavour is only used on servers that have a GPU with a compute capability of 3.5 or higher.
We are still working on the documentation for the selectors, so for now, you can check the source code of the Arkitekt Server to see what selectors are available.

### Building the container

To build the container and your plugins, you can run the following command:

```bash
arkitekt port build
```

This will build the container with your local docker daemon and add a new build in your local directory.
Importantly this build is not yet published and uploaded and can only be used on your local machine.

### Staging a build

Staging a Build allows you to test out your just build plugin against your local Arkitekt instance. To stage a build, you can run the following command:

```bash
arkitekt port stage
```

This will run the container locally and will instruct it to connect to your local Arkitekt instance. 
This will allow you to test your plugin in a real environment, as it would happen when you would publish your plugin.
This is a great way to test your plugin before you publish it.

### Publishing a build

To publish a build, you can run the following command:

```bash
arkitekt port publish
```

This is the final step in the process of building your plugin. This will upload your container to a registry, and will create
a new "deployment" of your plugin in the local directory. If you push your directory to a git repository, you can now point any
Arkitekt instance to this repository and it will be able to discover and use your plugin.

:::warning On Versioning

While you can have multiple builds for the same version of your plugin, you can only have one deployment for a version of your plugin.
So if you want to publish a new version of your plugin, you will have to change the version in your `manifest` by runnning
`arkitekt manifest version patch` or `arkitekt manifest version minor` or `arkitekt manifest version major` and then build and publish your plugin again.
:::

:::note On Registries

The current publishing process only supports the Docker Hub as a registry and as we do not have a central repository for plugins yet, relies on
github to host the metadata of the plugin. You can host this anywhere you want, as long as it is accessible by the Arkitekt Server, but hopefully
we will have a central repository for plugins in the future.

### Conclusion

And thats it for building your plugin. Of course, this is a very basic example, and there are many more things you can do with the flavour, but this should
get you started. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the community forums.
