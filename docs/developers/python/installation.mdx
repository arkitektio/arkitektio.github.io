# Getting Started!

The easiest way to install the library is to use poetry or pip:

```python
pip install "arkitekt[all]"
```

This will install the library with all its dependencies, including the Arkitekt
CLI as well as all supporting libraries for each service.

This is the recommend way to install arkitekt, especially if you are not planning
to use arkitekt as a dependency in another project.

:::info Modular Arkitekt
If you are planning to only
use arkitekt as a dependency in another project, you can install it without the
CLI and add it additional dependencies as needed.

```python
pip install arkitekt
# pip install mikro (for microscopy support)
# pip install rekuest (for registering nodes)
```

:::

## Choose your style

The best way to explore what Arkitekt can do is to follow one of the tutorials.
Here you can find a list of tutorials that will guide you through the process of
creating your first app. But first let's discuss the two different styles of developing
apps with Arkitekt. You can pick the one that suits your needs best.

## Classic

This is the most straight-forward way of **interacting** with Arkitekt and its
services if you want to interact and explore your data, and **use** functionality from other apps.
The Arkitekt API here sits in the background just like any other python library, and you
are in full control of the execution of your code.

```python
from arkitekt import easy
from mikro.api.schema import from_xarray
import numpy as np

# whatever python code

with easy("my_little_app",  url="http://localhost:8000"):
    # do stuff with the arkitekt api
    # new image
    img = np.random.rand(100, 100)
    image = from_xarray(img, name="my_image") # uploads image to the mikro service

# Whatever python code

```

This is a very simple example of how you can use the Arkitekt API to interact with the
services. Here we are creating an "easy" app (more about that later) and then we are
creating a new image and uploading it to the mikro service. Once we leave the context
manager, the app is automatically closed and your script can continue to run as usual.
Also you run this like any other python script, without any additional steps.

To get started with the classical style, you can follow the [Classic Tutorial](./classical/intro.md)

## Integrated

App that follow the `integrated style` are more integrated into the Arkitekt ecosystem.
The Integrated style is your best choice if you want to **provide new functionality** (nodes)
and develop your own Arkitekt App.  In the integrated style the Arkitekt CLI takes more control over your development process, ands streamline
the process of developing and your app publishing apps so that it can be used by other users.


```python
from arkitekt import register
from mikro.api.schema import from_xarray, RepresentationFragment

@register
def create_random_image(x_size: int, y_size: int) -> RepresentationFragment:
    """ Random Image

    Creates a random image with the given size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_size : int
        The size of the image in x direction.
    y_size : int
        The size of the image in y direction.

    Returns
    -------
    RepresentationFragment
        The created image.
    """

    img = np.random.rand(100, 100)

    return from_xarray(image, "Random Image")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # here you can run other code, that
    # will not be executed when the app is
    # run by the arkitekt cli
    pass

```

Here we are creating an app that can be run by the Arkitekt CLI and that
provides a Node (Add two Numbers) that can be used by other apps. The
`@register` decorator is used to mark a function as a node. 

While you can run this script like any other python script ( executing the
`if __name__ == "__main__"` block ) in the integrated style you are using
the Arkitekt CLI to run yout app via:

```bash
arkitekt run dev
```

The CLI will then create the App context for your app and register the functions
that are marked with the `@register` decorator as nodes

:::info Why do we use this?

This pattern might seem strange at first, but it has a few advantages, such as nice developer experience features like hot-reloading,
 but most importantly and easy portability of your app to other Arkitekt instances.
