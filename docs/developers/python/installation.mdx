# Getting Started!

The easiest way to install the library is to use poetry or pip:

```python
pip install "arkitekt[all]"
```

This will install the library with all its dependencies, including the Arkitekt
CLI as well as all supporting libraries for each service.

The Arkitekt CLI brings some additional features to your Arkitekt app, that
can be used to speed up your development process. These features include:

- A command line interface to create and manage projects
- Autogenerated code from the arkitekt api (GraphQL codegen)
- Dev mode to automatically reload the code when it changes
- A bundler to export your project as a PluginApp

This is the recommend way to install arkitekt, especially if you are not planning
to use arkitekt as a dependency in another project.

:::info Modular Arkitekt
If you are planning to only
use arkitekt as a dependency in another project, you can install it without the
CLI and add it additional dependencies as needed.

```python
pip install arkitekt
# pip install mikro (for microscopy support)
# pip install rekuest (for registering nodes)
```
