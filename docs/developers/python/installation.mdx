# Installation

The easiest way to install the library is to use poetry or pip:

```python
pip install "arkitekt[all]"
```

This will install the library with all its dependencies, including the Arkitekt
CLI. This bring some additional features to your Arkitekt app:

- A cli to create and manage projects
- Autogenerated code from the arkitekt api (GraphQL codegen)
- Dev mode to automatically reload the code when it changes
- A bundler to export your project as a standalone docker container

This is the recommend way to install arkitekt, especially if you are not planning
to use arkitekt as a dependency in another project.

:::note
If you are planning to only
use arkitekt as a dependency in another project, you can install it without the
CLI and add it additional dependencies as needed. You can checkout the functionality
of the submodules in the [Repository Section](./repositories).
```python
pip install arkitekt
```
