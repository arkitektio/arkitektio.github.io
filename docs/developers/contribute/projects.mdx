# Projects

The Arkitekt platform is a multi-project platform, each of which can develop on its own pace and with its own development team. These projects align with
the Arktiekt platform's architecture and therefore its (micro)-services, all of which are managed in seperate github repositories, that include an increasing
set of automation tools to help with the development process. With this multi-project approach we would like to ensure more agile development process, where each project can
be developed and released independently of the other projects, and that you can choose which projects you want to use in your own Arkitekt platform.

On this page now you will be able to find an overview of all the projects that are part of the Arkitekt platform, and links to their respective repositories.

:::info On the Arkitekt platform's architecture

The sheer number of projects that are part of the Arkitekt platform might seem overwhelming at first, but you will have to only interact with a small subset of them.
Also if you don't know which part of the platform you encounter a problem with just post it on the main [github issues page](https://github.com/arkitektio/arkitektio.github.io/issues)
and we will make sure to help you out and point you in the right direction.

## Arkitekt Core

The Arkitekt Core project is the core of the Arkitekt platform, and contains the core services that are required to run the Arkitekt platform. This includes the
the webservers that are required to run the standard Arkitekt platform, but also the projects that are required to run the Arkitekt platform in a custom configuration.

#### Services

- [Lok](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/lok-server): Authorization and Authentication service
- [Rekuest](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/rekuest-server): Node Repository and Task-Assignment
- [Port](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/port-server): Vritualization of plugin apps
- [Mikro](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro-server): Microscopy Data Management
- [Fluss](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/port-server): Workflow management

#### GUI Clients

- [Orkestrator](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/orkestrator): The standard Arkitekt platform client (both desktop-app and web-app)

#### Management Tools

- [Konstruktor](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/konstruktor): The Arkitekt platform management tool (installer + admin)

## Arkitekt SDK

The Arkitekt SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop apps and plugins for the Arkitekt platform. The SDK is currently available in Python
and partially in Javascript/Typescript (currently restricted to the React framework).

### Python

The python SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop apps and plugins for the Arkitekt platform. You can find a global documentation for the
tools here in the documentation. The modules however also have their own documentation, which you can find in the respective repositories. All projects
are managed with poetry.

#### Meta Packages

- [arkitekt](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt): A one-stop-shop for all the Arkitekt SDK tools for Python (includes the `arkitekt` CLI tool)

#### Core library

- [rekuest](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/rekuest): A Python client for the Rekuest service, with convenience methods for quickly creating and running nodes
- [mikro](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro): A Python client for the Mikro service, with convenience methods to interact with your data through common python abstractions (numpy, pandas, xarray, ...)
- [fluss](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/fluss): A Python client for Fluss service, to retrieve and alter workflows
- [unlok](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/unlok): A Python client for the Lok service, to interact with users, write comments, and manage permissions
- [port](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/port): A Python client for Fluss service, with convenience methods to create and run plugins
- [reaktion](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/reaktion): A Scheduler for Fluss workflows, that can execute locally or use arkitekt to to run nodes remotely

#### Supporting libraries

These libaries provide non arkitekt specific functionality, but are used in the Arkitekt SDK.

- [fakts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/fakts): An asynchronous configuration retriever, that can help in automatically retrieving configuration from the Arkitekt platform
- [herre](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/herre): An asynchronous Oauth2 client, that provides various strategies to authenticate users with Arkitekt
- [turms](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/turms): An easy code-generator that can help bridge Arkitekt GraphQL queries to native python objects
- [rath](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/rath): A GraphQL client for Python, that can be used to interact with any GraphQL API
- [koil](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/koil): An async-sync bridge, that faciliates the integration of the async Arkitekt SDK with syncronous code or other event-loops e.g. in Jupyter notebooks, or in a QTApp

### Typescript

The Typescript SDK is primarily designed around enabling the development of React apps for the Arkitekt platform. As Arkitekt is a web-server based
platform this SDK is currently wrapping the GraphQL API of the Arkitekt platform very slimly without too many convenience methods. The organisation
closely mimics the python SDK, with a few exceptions. All projects are managed with yarn.

#### Meta Packages

- [arkitekt-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-ts): A one-stop-shop for all the Arkitekt SDK tools for Python (includes the `arkitekt` CLI tool)

#### Core library

- [rekuest-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/rekuest-ts): A Python client for the Rekuest service, with convenience methods for quickly creating and running nodes
- [mikro-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro-ts): A Python client for the Mikro service, with convenience methods to interact with your data through common python abstractions (numpy, pandas, xarray, ...)
- [fluss-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/fluss-ts): A Python client for Fluss service, to retrieve and alter workflows
- [port-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/port-ts): A Python client for Fluss service, with convenience methods to create and run plugins

#### Supporting libraries

These libaries provide non arkitekt specific functionality, but are used in the Arkitekt SDK.

- [fakts-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/fakts-ts): An asynchronous configuration retriever, that can help in automatically retrieving configuration from the Arkitekt platform
- [herre-ts](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/herre-ts): An asynchronous Oauth2 client, that provides various strategies to authenticate users with Arkitekt

## Arkitekt Apps

Additionaly to the Arkitekt platform, we manage a set of apps that are developed by the Arkitekt team, and that can be used to interact with the Arkitekt platform.
They are all open-source and can be used as a starting point for your own apps.

### Standalone GUI Applications

- [mikroj](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikroj): The Arktitekt FIJI bridge (powered by pyimagej)
- [gucker](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/gucker): The Arkitekt FileWatcher App (used in streaming worfklows)

### Arkitekt Next

Arkitekt next services are the next generation of Arkitekt services, with lessons learned from this iteration, that are currently in development. They are not yet ready for external use, but
will provide a more flexible and scalable architecture for the Arkitekt platform, based on the [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/) GraphQL framework.
The transition to the new architecture will be gradual, and (besided mikro-next) will not require changes to the Arkitekt SDK. However
the new architecture will require a new set of GUI clients, that are devleoped in paralel. Once deemed stable a migration guide will be provided.
The progress of the development is currently not public, but if you are interested please ask any time.
