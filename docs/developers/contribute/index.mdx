# Arkitekt development

So you would like to contribute to the Arkitekt development. Great! We would love that.
Every individual, regardless of their skill level, can contribute to our open-source project. We love to see people getting involved in the community and helping each other out.
Here's how you can be a part of it:

1. **Submitting Issues**

   Found a bug or have a feature suggestion? Your feedback is vital. Report any anomalies or ideas via our Issue Tracker on Github.
   It helps our developers stay updated with what needs attention.

   Here is the [link](https://github.com/arkitektio/arkitektio.github.io/issues) to our main Github Page

2. **Pointing Out Errors**

   Both our documentation and code undergo continuous improvement and arkitekt is still in an early setup. If you spot inaccuracies or unclear areas, do let us know.
   Your keen eye can make a difference.

   Where to highlight errors: Each Page in this documentatoni has a an Edit Page button. Just click it and you can edit the page directly in Github. Don't worry
   in being concise or solving the error. Pointing it out with a "UNCLEAR" is enough. We will try to take care of the rest.

3. **Joining Sub-projects**

   The Arkitekt platform is vast, and we have various sub-projects or modules. We recommend to first get familiar with developing an App with Arkitekt, to see where you would
   like to see changes or improvements. Then you can join the sub-project that you are most interested in.

   Explore sub-projects [here](/docs/developers/contribute/projects)

4. **Contact the Community**

   Our small community tries to organizes calls or meetings. This is your chance to sync up with our project's heartbeat, raise queries, or share insights.
   At this early stage meetings are not scheduler reguarly but just reach out on github or via [email](mailto:johannes.roos@jku.at) to get in touch.
