We now have a basic understanding of how to call an conversion node on your data, we can visualize the results, now lets put it all together and create our first workflow,
spanning the most basic nodes.

Here we will use our uploaded image, max project it, threshold it (yeah analysis), and then measure the fraction of the image that is above the threshold (
yeah quantification). In the course of this tutorial you will get to understand:

- What even are workflows?
- What is a Workflow Scheduler?
- How to create a workflow?
- How to deploy a workflow on a Scheduler?

## Before we start

You are familiar with this by now.. There are a few things we need to do before we can start.
First what do we mean with `Workflow`?

A workflow in the arkitekt sense is a processing pipeline, that uses a series of `Nodes` to process your data in a stream. Nodes just like
our previously mentioned `Show on Napari` or `Convert File` nodes. You can either stitch them together in the GUI or you can import them from a file or
even this website. We will do the first. Hopefully this will help you in familiarizing yourself a bit more with the UI .

Lets look first at the workflow we would like to create, and then we will go through the steps to create it.

<DisplayWorkflow flow={simpleWorkflow} blockImport />
<div className="text-gray-400 mb-2">
  <small>
    {" "}
    This is the workflow we would like to create. For now we disabled the import
    feature.. You should really try to create it on your own{" "}
  </small>
</div>

This is probably the most basic workflow you can create, but it will teach you a lot about the Arkitekt `Workflow` and its design. A few things to note here.

- This is an Arkitekt `Workflow` that we just exported from Arkitekt and then embeded in this website.

  Arkitekt workflows are just visual representations of a processing workflow. They are stored in a JSON file, and can be imported and exported from Arkitekt.
  You can also import them from this website, but we will get to that later.

- About the `Nodes`.

  Nodes in Arkitekt Workflows are front and center. They are the building blocks of your workflow, and thusly the building blocks of your analysis. As you have seen
  in the previous section every `Node` has inputs and outputs that you can connect to other nodes. This connection then defines the **flow of data** through your workflow. Importantly you will
  notice the nodes termed `Input` and `Output`. These are special nodes that are part of every workflow, and are the entry and exit points to your analysis.
  When you connect a node to the `Input` node, you are telling Arkitekt that your workflow will expect the input type of that node as a parameter when you run it.
  Equally you connect a node to the `Output` node, you are telling Arkitekt that your workflow will return the output type of that node when you run it.

  :::info Workflows are Just Nodes

  This abstraction of `Input` and `Output` nodes is core to the concept of a workflow in Arkitekt. Each workflow has exactly one `Input` and one `Output` node.
  And as our workflows are just nodes, these inputs and outputs will then be the inputs and outputs of the workflow node. This means that you can use workflows
  in workflows, and you can use workflows just as nodes on your data. But we will get to that later.

  :::

- About their colors:

  If you have connected the website and followed the tutorial until now, you might notice that the color of the nodes is yellow. This is because
  we have not yet installed apps that provide the functionality for the nodes in this workflow. This illustrates another core feature of Arkitekt. The separation
  of the workflow design and the workflow execution. You can design and share a workflow, irrespective of the apps that provide the functionality for the nodes in the workflow.
  This means that you can design a workflow, and potentially share it with others, even though they might run in on completely different apps. This makes workflows
  a great way to share analysis pipelines, and to make them reproducible and **universal**

- About the data as a stream:

  Arkitekt workflows are adapted to process your data as a [stream](/docs/design/real-time), rather than as a batch. This means that each node will process your data as it comes in, and then
  pass it on to the next node. Nodes will not wait for all data to be processed, but will process it autonomously as it comes in. This means that you can process data ridicously fast,
  and importantly you can process data that is still being generated. This is a core feature of Arkitekt, and we will get to it later. You will also
  note that the edges are labeled with `@mikro/representatoin` and `@mikro/metric`. These labels correspond to the data types that are passed between the nodes. The `@` symbol
  indicates that these are [mikro](/docs/service/mikro) data types and the `representation` and `metric` indicate the type of data.
  The first two nodes will manipulate an image to an image (images are represented as `representation`), and the last node will return a `metric` (metrics are scalar values attached
  to an image (here the fraction)). This `metric` will also be the output of our node.

## Enough talking

Lets start by creating this workflow. First we need to install the apps that provide the functionality for the nodes in this workflow.
We will need two new plugins for this workflow, so lets install them. One plugin will provide all of our functionality need to run this workflow in.
The other plugin will be used to actually run the workflow in the background. So lets install them.

## New plugins

First we need to install the apps that provide the functionality for the nodes in this workflow.

<HerreGuard fallback={<div>

If appears you are not logged in. Its easier to login to install the plugins.
But don't you worry, we will guide you through it.

First lets install the Standard Libary plugin [`Stdlib`](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/stdlib) plugin, which provides a battery of basic
image processing nodes. You can install it by clicking on the "Plugin Store", and adding the "Stdlib" repository.
Users: `jhnnsrs`, Repository: `stdlib`, Branch: `master`. You then follow the [previously outlined](./first_tool#installing-our-first-app) steps to `Appify` the latest stdlib version, and deploy it
to your server.

Then we will need the [`Reaktor`](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/reaktor) plugin, which will acts a `scheduler` for our workflow. Don't worry
you will understand what that means in a second. You can install it by clicking on the "Plugin Store", and adding the "Reaktor" repository.
Users: `jhnnsrs`, Repository: `reaktor`, Branch: `main`. Again followig the [previously outlined](./first_tool#installing-our-first-app) steps to `Appify` the latest reaktor version, and deploy it

If you now search for `Deploy Flow` and `Crop Image` in the search bar, you should find the two nodes we just installed.
If you don't, make sure you have the correct repository selected in the search bar, and your installation was successful.
Also if you refresh this page the nodes in the workflow should now appear green.

</div>
}>

You saw these button in the last section:

<div className="flex flex-row gap-2">
  <InstallRepoButton repo={"stdlib"} user={"jhnnsrs"} branch={"master"} />
  <InstallRepoButton repo={"reaktor"} user={"jhnnsrs"} branch={"master"} />
</div>

Now follow [previously outlined](./first_tool#installing-our-first-app) steps to `Appify` the latest `stdlib` and `reaktor` version, and deploy them to your server.
You should now be able to search for `Deploy Flow` and `Otsu Threshold` in the dashboard search bar, and find the two nodes we just installed.

</HerreGuard>

## Reserving a Scheduler

Before we are creating a workflow that will be executed in the background, we will go ahead and decide on a `Scheduler`. A `Scheduler` like so many things in Arkitekt
is just a fancy `App`, just like a `Workflow` is just a `Node`. What this `Scheduler` App will do, is to actually `run` our workflow for us when we call it. It will take care
of the execution of the workflow tasks, and will make sure to call the right node at the right time. Imaging it like a conductor of an orchestra. It will receive the inputs and
outputs of all of the workflow nodes and pipe them together just like our workflow blueprint suggests.

In the Arkitekt ecosystem `Schedulers` play a vital role and we actually have installed the two major `Scheduler` types in our previous steps.

- The first type are `fully distributed` Schedulers: This type of Scheduler will call Arkitekt as a middleman for the handling of each workflow step. That means that when you assign a workflow to this type of Scheduler,
  it will call Arkitekt to run the first node, route the result to the node internal, and ask Arkitekt to run the second node on the result, and so on. This type of Scheduler is great where input and outputs span multiple apps
  and data is stored centrally (just like in our case). Its also a more fault-tolerant type of Scheduler, as it normally runs directly on the Arkitekt server and thus has direct access to the platform and won't
  suffer from network errors. The downside is that it will be slower, as it will have to call Arkitekt for each step.

- The second type are `partially distributed` Schedulers.

  This one is a bit more complicated to explain: As mentioned `Schedulers` are just `Apps` and indeed **every** app in Arkitekt can decide to become a Scheduler, if they implement the `Deploy Flow` node.
  Wouldn't it be great if they could just call their own nodes directly? Well they can.
  `partially distributed` or `ìn-app` Schedulers are Schedulers that will call their own nodes directly, _without_ the need to call Arkitekt. This means that they can schedule tasks much faster, as they don't have to call Arkitekt for each step.
  This type of Scheduler is great for workflows where nodes are contained mostly within a single app, and where performance is key. They are also immensly useful for workflow that work `completely` local with **in memory data** in one app.
  You can see an example of that in our experimental [MikroJ in memory workflow](/docs/showcases/advanced). The downside is that they are more fault-prone, as they are not running on the Arkitekt server
  and if the Scheduling app goes down, the workflow will fail.

The TLDR of which workflow scheduling to choose is: In 99% of cases you will want to use the `fully distributed` Schedulers, as they are more fault tolerant to network errors.

:::info About Schedulers

Schedulers are a core concept in Arkitekt. They are the conductor of your workflow, and they will make sure that your workflow is executed correctly. They are however also a quite advanced
concept, and you need to probably understand the Arkitekt design a bit better to fully understand their nuances. So don't worry if you don't understand them fully yet. We will try to give you some guidance
in other parts of the [documentation](/docs/design/scheduler).
:::

But lets to just that and prepare a `Scheduler` for our workflow. For this we will use the `Reaktor` app, which we installed in the previous step. `Reaktor` is a distributed `Scheduler` app,
that will call Arkitekt for each step of the workflow. We will now go ahead and reserve the `Deploy Flow` node of that app, which when called will associate that workflow with that app and
create a `Node` that is bound to that scheduler.

</video>

1. Open the `Dashboard` in the sidebar

   You can find the `Deploy Flow` node in the search bar. It is part of the `Reaktor` app, which we installed in the previous step. You can find it by searching for `Deploy Flow` in the search bar.

2. Reserve the Node by Drag and Drop `Reserve`

   In the upcoming Reserve Dialog this time do **NOT** choose Reaktor as an App but rather directly reserve the "Reaktor app" by clicking. This will reserve the `Deploy Flow` node of the `Reaktor` app.
   Every workflow that you now give this node as an input, will be associated with the `Reaktor` app, and will be executed by it.

:::info Workflow Deployment

When you deploy a workflow, you are telling Arkitekt to associate that workflow with a `Scheduler`. This means that when `Deploy Flow`, you will call a functionality that dynamically creates a `Node`
on the Arkitekt platform that is associated with that `Scheduler`. This newly created `Node` is then your new way of calling that workflow. You can then call that `Workflow Node` just like any other `Node` on your data.
:::

:::caution About this process

While we believe the abstraction of workflows as nodes and their deployment again through nodes is a powerful one, we see how it can be a bit confusing at first. We will soon encapsulate this part of the process in a more user friendly way, but for now
you will have to go through this process. However if anything it should give you a better understanding of the Arkitekt design.

:::

## Creating the workflow

Now that we have the `Nodes` we need and a potential `Scheduler` lets create the workflow. For this we can finally go to the `Workflow` tab in the sidebar.
Here we can see a list of all our workflows, and we can create a new one by clicking on the "Create Workflow" button.

You will be presented by the Arkitekt Workflow Designer, which is a drag and drop interface to create workflows.
You can drag `Nodes` from the nodes sidebar into the workflow, and connect them by dragging the output of one `Node` to the input of another.

Lets see the design in progress.

<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  controls
  className="rounded rounded-md"
  width={"100%"}
>
  <source src={createWorkflow} />
</video>

1. Open the `Workflows` tab in the sidebar

   The Worksflows tab is where you can create and manage your workflows, that you can create and run on your data.

2. Click on `Create Workspace` on the bottom right.

   Give it a Name like "Analysis Run" and click on "Create".
   A workspace is a place to create and manage versions of your workflow. Workflows are automatically versioned, that means
   if you change a workflow, you will create a new version of it. This is important for reproducibility and traceability of your analysis.

3. You are now presented with the Arkitekt Workflow Designer.

   The Arkitekt Workflow Designer is a drag and drop interface to create workflows. You can drag nodes from the nodes sidebar into the workflow,
   and connect them by dragging the output of one node to the input of another. Just search for your nodes in the search bar, and drag them into the workflow.
   Make sure to connect the `Input` and `Output` nodes to your workflow, as they are required for each workflow.

4. Set necessary parameters on the sidebar.

   Some nodes require you to specify parameters. You can do that by clicking on the node, and then setting the parameters in the sidebar. For example the `Otsu Threshold` node requires you to specify
   if you want to use a gaussian blur before thresholding.This is not necessary for our workflow, so we can leave it at the default value. However you can change the value that should be measure
   by the `Measure Fraction` node. You can do that by clicking on the node, and then setting the parameters in the sidebar. We are interested in the `Fraction` of the image that is below the threshold,
   so we can change it at to the 0 value. Also we can rename the Metric key to "Background Fraction", to be more descriptive.

5. Save the workflow

   You can save the workflow by clicking on the "Save" button on the bottom right. This will save the workflow to your server, making it ready to be deployed.

6. Deploy the workflow

   This is now the final step. We now have a workflow, but we need to deploy it to a `Scheduler`. For this we can use the `Deploy Flow` node we reserved in the previous step.
   Arkitekt will automatically prompt us with this Node when we click deploy on a workflow. So lets do that. Click on the `Deploy` button on the bottom right. You will be prompted with a dialog
   where you can now select our `Deploy Flow` reservation. This will open an Assign dialog where you can give the Node a dedicated Name (this is the name of the node that will be created on the platform)
   and choose advanced paramters like the `Stream behaviour` don't worry about that right now. You can leave it at the default value. Click on `Assign` and you are done.

7. You should now see a Popup in the bottom right

   If everything was successful you should now see a popup in the bottom right, that tells you that your workflow was successfully deployed. You can now close the workflow designer and go back to the dashboard.

:::note About the Deployment

Once you pressed `Deploy` you were prompted with an `Assign Dialog`. This Dialog is indeed the exact same type of dialog that we saw in the previous section, when we used the `Convert Omero` node.
And indeed the process is the same. When you deploy a workflow, you are just calling a functionality that dynamically creates a `Node` on the Arkitekt platform that is associated with that App (which is then its `Scheduler`). We hope
especially Developers will appreciate that a `Node` can recursively create `Nodes`. Indeed they can easily create powerful third party schedulers, that will feel native to the Arkitekt ecosystem.

## Running the workflow

Well as a workflow is now just a Node, Running it on our data should seem quite straightforward. Lets see that in the next section...
