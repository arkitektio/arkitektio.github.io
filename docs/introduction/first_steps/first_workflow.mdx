We now have a basic understanding of how to call an conversion node on your data, we can visualize the results, now lets put it all together and create our first workflow,
spanning the most basic nodes.

Here we will use our uploaded image, mark a ROI in Napari and then crop the image around that roi and max project it.
Sounds simple enough, lets get started.

## Before we start

You are familiar with this by now, there are a few things we need to do before we can start. First what do we mean with  Workflow? 
A workflow in the arkitekt sense is a processing pipeline, that uses a series of nodes to process your data. Nodes just like 
our previously mentioned "Show on Napari" or "Convert File" nodes. You can either stitch them together in the GUI or you can import them from a file or 
even this website. We will do the first, but you can find more information on the other two options in the [documentation](/docs/). One important
feature to understand in Arkitekt is that Workflows are not that different from Nodes, indeed they are just a special type of node. This means that
you can use workflows in workflows, and you can use workflows just as nodes on your data. So lets get started.

## New plugins

We will need two new plugins for this workflow, so lets install them. One plugin will provide the functionality to actually crop the image and to max project it.
The other plugin will be used to actually run the workflow in the background. So lets install them.

First lets install the Standard Libary plugin [`Stdlib`](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/stdlib) plugin, which provides a batter of basic
image processing nodes. You can install it by clicking on the "Plugin Store", and adding the "Stdlib" repository. 
Users: `jhnnsrs`, Repository: `stdlib`, Branch: `master`. You then follow the [previously outlined](./first_tool#installing-our-first-app) steps to Appify the latest stdlib version, and deploy it
to your server. 

Then we will need the [`Reaktor`](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/reaktor) plugin, which will acts a `scheduler` for our workflow. Don't worry
you will understand what that means in a second. You can install it by clicking on the "Plugin Store", and adding the "Reaktor" repository.
Users: `jhnnsrs`, Repository: `reaktor`, Branch: `main`. Again followig the [previously outlined](./first_tool#installing-our-first-app) steps to Appify the latest reaktor version, and deploy it

If you now search for `Deploy Flow` and `Crop Image` in the search bar, you should find the two nodes we just installed.
If you don't, make sure you have the correct repository selected in the search bar, and your installation was successful.

## Creating the workflow

Now that we have the nodes we need, lets create the workflow. For this we can finally go to the "Workflow" tab in the sidebar.
Here we can see a list of all our workflows, and we can create a new one by clicking on the "Create Workflow" button.

You will be presented by the Arkitekt Workflow Designer, which is a drag and drop interface to create workflows.
You can drag nodes from the nodes side bar into the workflow, and connect them by dragging the output of one node to the input of another.

Lets see the design in progress.
