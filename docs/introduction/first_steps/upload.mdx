# Upload your data

In this section, we will upload our first data to the platform, and convert it to a format that can be used by the platform and all connected tools.
Here you will learn how to:

- Upload data to the platform
- Install our first plugin tool to convert data
- Convert our data to an Image
- Visualize our data on the Arkitekt platform

## Upload data

Uploading data to the platform is easy. You can simple drag and drop your data into the platform. Multiple files can be uploaded at once. 
The platform will try to auomatically detect the file type and show you the file type in the file list.

<video controls autoplay muted className="rounded rounded-md" width={"100%"}>
  <source src={upAndDownURL}/>
</video>
