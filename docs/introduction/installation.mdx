## Before we start

Before you start, allow a few comments about the installation of the arkitekt platform. Arkitekt
is a web-server platform, that was designed to scale from the needs of one person to the needs of
a large organization. You can install it on your own computer, or on a server in your lab, or
on a server in the cloud. Depending on the scenario, the installation process will differ
as you might want to adjust the platform and its dependencies to your needs.

The core strategies of the installation process are:

- **Graphical Installer**, that will guide you through the installation process and will install
  all dependencies for you. This is the **recommended** way to install arkitekt on your own computer,
  if you are not familiar with the command line, and want to get started quickly. The installer
  will guide you through the installation and install the most common modules of the platform.

- **Docker-Compose**, this strategy includes a docker-compose configuration that sets up the platform
  exposing you to some decent amount of configuration options. This is the recommended way to install 
  arkitekt if you want to participate in the development of the platform, or if you want to integrate
  it in a larger infrastructure of your lab or institute that is powered by docker-compose.

- **Helm Charts ** (coming soon), this strategy includes a helm chart that sets up the platform
  exposing you on a kubernetes cluster.

- **Custom Installation**, you shouldn't really choose this strategy, unless you are a developer and
  are already familiar with the platform and its smaller subservices. Your on your own here, but
  you can find some hints in the.


## Graphical installer

Go ahead and download our installer for your operating system "Konstruktor" , and follow the instructions:

<DownloadGrid/>


This installer ( once installed) will guide you through the installation process and the deployment of the  platform on your specific hardware. It will also give you a rough estimate of the resources you will need for the installation. Once installed it will serves  simple desktop app that  additionaly acts as an updater ,  as well as and admin interface to the platform and allows you to **start** and **stop** the platform. Additionaly it will act as a beacon
that advertises the platform on your local network, so that other users can find it.

Konstruktor necessitates the installation of a container runtime (Docker) on the machine where you want to install arkitekt.
If you don't have docker installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Docker
is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and is the sole outside dependency of the arkitekt platform. Please check out
the FAQ section for more information about the installation of docker especially when you are seeking to use GPU support
on your machine.

## Docker-Compose

If you are familiar with docker-compose, you can use the docker-compose configuration to set up the platform. We maintain
an active repository with the docker-compose configuration that you can find [here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-server).
This includes already the configuration for the most common modules of the platform, and when cloned with the submodules
(`git clone --recurse-submodules``) will also include the source code of the platform. If you encounter any problems with
the docker-compose configuration, please open an issue in the repository.


## Helm Charts

We are currently working on a helm chart that will allow you to install arkitekt on a kubernetes cluster. This will be
available soon. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-helm). For now, you can use the
docker-compose configuration to set up the platform on a kubernetes cluster using the [kompose](https://kompose.io/) tool.

## Custom installation

From here be dragons. You can find some hints in the  developer section of each module and consult each sub
modules documentation for more information about the installation of the platform. At this point however you are on your
own. If you encounter any problems, please open an issue in the respective repository.
