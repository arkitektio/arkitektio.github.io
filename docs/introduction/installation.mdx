## Before we start

Before you start, allow a few comments about the installation of the arkitekt platform. Arkitekt
is a server platform, that was designed to scale from the needs of one person to the needs of
a large organization. You can install it on your own computer, or on a server in your lab, or
on a server in the cloud. Depending on the scenario, the installation process will differ
as you might want to adjust the platform and its dependencies to your needs.

The core strategies of the installation process are:

- **Graphical Installer**, that will guide you through the installation process and will install
  all dependencies for you. This is the **recommended** way to install arkitekt on your own computer,
  if you are not familiar with the command line, and want to get started quickly. The installer
  will guide you through the installation and install the most common modules of the platform.

- **Docker-Compose**, this strategy includes a docker-compose configuration that sets up the platform
  exposing you to some decent amount of configuration options. This is the recommended way to install 
  arkitekt if you want to participate in the development of the platform, or if you want to integrate
  it in a larger infrastructure of your lab or institute that is powered by docker-compose.

- **Helm Charts ** (coming soon), this strategy includes a helm chart that sets up the platform
  exposing you on a kubernetes cluster.

## System Requirements 

The arkitekt platform is designed to run on a variety of different hardware and different operating systems.
However as a quite involved platform that is at the moment not heavily optimized to run on low-end hardware,
we recommed to not install Arkitekt on a machine with less than **16GB of RAM** and a **decent modern CPU (i7 or i9)** while
reserving  **at least 50GB of free disk space** on a **SSD drive**.
While it is perfectly possible to run the platform on a machine with less resources (indeed it works on a Raspberry Pi 4),
especially the transfer of large amounts of data will be slow and the platform will be sluggish. 

If you want to use Arkitekt with GPU enabled (deep learning modules), we also recommend to have a **CUDA 11** enabled **Nvidia GPU** with at least
**8GB of VRAM**. If you want to use the GPU for training, we recommend to have at least **16GB of VRAM**.

:::note About GPU support

Arkitekt makes us of the modern pattern of [Docker GPU Support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html)
to enable GPU support for the platform. This means that you **do not** have to install the CUDA toolkit on your machine, but you need to make sure
that you are running the latest NVIDIA drivers on your machine. Arkitekt will take care of the rest.

:::caution About Apple Silicon

Arkitekt is currently build for the x86-64 architecture. This means that it will run in an **emulated mode** on Apple Silicon. This emulated mode
while functional is not optimized for performance and will be slower than on a native x86-64 machine. We are currently in the midst of transitioning
our services also to other architectures and will provide native support for Apple Silicon in the future. For now we highly recommend to use a
Windows or Linux machine to run Arkitekt.

## Graphical installer (recommended)


<Image img={thumbnail} />

Arkitekts installer  and admin interface ( once installed) will guide you through the installation process and the deployment of the  platform on your specific hardware.
Once installed it will serves simple desktop app that  additionaly acts as an updater, as well as and admin interface to the platform and allows you to **start** and **stop** the platform. 
Additionaly it will act as a beacon that advertises the platform on your local network, so that other users can find it.

Go ahead and download our installer for your operating system "Konstruktor" , and follow the instructions:

<DownloadGrid/>




Konstruktor necessitates the installation of a container runtime (Docker) on the machine where you want to install arkitekt.
If you don't have docker installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Docker
is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and is the sole outside dependency of the arkitekt platform. You do *not* need to create 
a docker acount in order to use it for Arkitekt. Please check out the FAQ section for more information about the installation of 
docker especially when you are seeking to use GPU support on your machine.

:::note About Channels

Konstruktor allows you to install different versions (termed "channels") of the platform. The default current channel is the
**"paper"** channel, which is the most stable version of the platform and designed to faciliate workflows of the original paper.
If you want to try out the latest features of the platform and the "lessons learned" from the paper, you can switch to the
"next" channel which is a more recent version that is only managable by developers.

## Docker-Compose

If you are familiar with docker-compose, you can use the docker-compose configuration to set up the platform. We maintain
an active repository with the docker-compose configuration that you can find [here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-server).
This includes already the configuration for the most common modules of the platform, and when cloned with the submodules
(`git clone --recurse-submodules``) will also include the source code of the platform. If you encounter any problems with
the docker-compose configuration, please open an issue in the repository.


## Helm Charts

We are currently working on a helm chart that will allow you to install arkitekt on a kubernetes cluster. This will be
available soon. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-helm). For now, you can use the
docker-compose configuration to set up the platform on a kubernetes cluster using the [kompose](https://kompose.io/) tool.

## Custom installation

From here be dragons. You can find some hints in the  developer section of each module and consult each sub
modules documentation for more information about the installation of the platform. At this point however you are on your
own. If you encounter any problems, please open an issue in the respective repository.
