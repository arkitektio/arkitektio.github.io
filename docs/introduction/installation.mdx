## Before we start

Before you start, allow a few comments about the installation of the arkitekt platform. Arkitekt
is a server platform, that was designed to scale from the needs of one person to the needs of
a large organization. You can install it on your own computer, or on a server in your lab, or
on a server in the cloud. Depending on the scenario, the installation process will differ
as you might want to adjust the platform and its dependencies to your needs.

The core strategies of the installation process are:

- **Graphical Installer**, that will guide you through the installation process and will install
  all dependencies for you. This is the **recommended** way to install arkitekt on your own computer,
  if you are not familiar with the command line, and want to get started quickly. The installer
  will guide you through the installation and install the most common modules of the platform.

- **Docker-Compose**, this strategy includes a docker-compose configuration that sets up the platform
  exposing you to some decent amount of configuration options. This is the recommended way to install 
  arkitekt if you want to participate in the development of the platform, or if you want to integrate
  it in a larger infrastructure of your lab or institute that is powered by docker-compose.

- **Helm Charts ** (coming soon), this strategy includes a helm chart that sets up the platform
  exposing you on a kubernetes cluster.

:::note Where to install 

The Arkitekt platform was designed as a multi-user platfrom that gets installed *once* on a **powerful** server and then
can be accessed by multiple users and apps, on standard hardware. However it is also possible to install the platform on your own computer and
use it as a `personal` platform. As long as not all safety features are implemented and audited, we recommend to use the platform
in the latter way. We'll keep you posted, when we think the platform is safe ready for multi-user installations! 

:::


## System Requirements 

The arkitekt platform is designed to run on a variety of different hardware and different operating systems.
However as a quite involved platform that is at the moment not heavily optimized to run on low-end hardware,
we recommed to not install Arkitekt on a machine with less than **16GB of RAM** and a **decent modern CPU (i7 or i9)** while
reserving  **at least 50GB of free disk space** on a **SSD drive**.
While it is perfectly possible to run the platform on a machine with less resources (indeed it works on a Raspberry Pi 4),
especially the transfer of large amounts of data will be slow and the platform will be sluggish. 

If you want to use Arkitekt with GPU enabled (deep learning modules), we also recommend to have a **CUDA 11** enabled **Nvidia GPU** with at least
**8GB of VRAM**. If you want to use the GPU for training, we recommend to have at least **16GB of VRAM**.

Also note that the platform should be installed on a machine with a good network interface (preferably a wired connection) and a good internet connection.
As a central middleman between different services, the platform will transfer a lot of data between different services and a slow network connection
will slow down the platform. Also note that in our tests, on equal hardware, the platform runs much faster on Linux than on Windows and Mac OS X.

:::note About GPU support

Arkitekt makes us of the modern pattern of [Docker GPU Support](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/index.html)
to enable GPU support for the platform. This means that you **do not** have to install the CUDA toolkit on your machine, but you need to make sure
that you are running the latest NVIDIA drivers on your machine. Arkitekt will take care of the rest. If you have troubles with GPU support, please
consult the [Troubleshooting section](/docs/troubleshooting/startup) for more information.

:::caution About Apple Silicon

Arkitekt is currently build for the x86-64 architecture. This means that it will run in an **emulated mode** on Apple Silicon. This emulated mode
while functional is not optimized for performance and will be slower than on a native x86-64 machine. We are currently in the midst of transitioning
our services also to other architectures and will provide native support for Apple Silicon in the future. For now we highly recommend to use a
Windows or Linux machine to run Arkitekt.

## Graphical installer (recommended)


<Image img={thumbnail} />

Arkitekts installer  and admin interface ( once installed) will guide you through the installation process and the deployment of the  platform on your specific hardware.
Once installed it will serves simple desktop app that  additionaly acts as an updater, as well as and admin interface to the platform and allows you to **start** and **stop** the platform. 
Additionaly it will act as a beacon that advertises the platform on your local network, so that other users can find it.

Go ahead and download our installer for your operating system "Konstruktor" , and follow the instructions:

<DownloadGrid/>




Konstruktor necessitates the installation of a container runtime (Docker) on the machine where you want to install arkitekt.
If you don't have docker installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Docker
is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and is the sole outside dependency of the arkitekt platform. You do *not* need to create 
a docker acount in order to use it for Arkitekt. Please check out the FAQ section for more information about the installation of 
docker especially when you are seeking to use GPU support on your machine.

:::note About Channels

Konstruktor allows you to install different versions (termed "channels") of the platform. The default current channel is the
**"paper"** channel, which is the most stable version of the platform and designed to faciliate workflows of the original paper.
If you want to try out the latest features of the platform and the "lessons learned" from the paper, you can switch to the
"next" channel which is a more recent version that is only managable by developers.

## Updating

Once installed, the installer will also act as an updater for the platform. Arkitekt is a rapidly evolving platform and we are constantly
adding new features and fixing bugs. Updating of the platform is therefore a crucial part of the platform. You are encouraged to update
your `channel` of the platform regularly to get the latest features and bugfixes. You can update the platform by clicking on the "Danger"
button in the dashboard interface of the installer, and then selecting `Update`. The installer will then download the latest version of the
platform images. This might take a while, depending on your internet connection. Once the download is finished, you can then apply the update
by clicking on the `Start` button. This will cause a "rolling update" of the platform, which means that the platform should update without any
downtime. If you encounter any problems with the update, please consult the [Troubleshooting section](/docs/troubleshooting/startup) for more information.

:::note About updating

At this early stage of the platform, updating is a crucial part of the platform. We are constantly adding new features and fixing bugs, and
updating the platform is the only way to get the latest features and bugfixes. The updates in one channel should `always` be backwards compatible
and your data should be safe.

## Advertising

One benefirt of the graphical installer is that it can also advertise the platform on your local network. This means that
other users and apps can find the platform on your local network and connect to it, without having to know the IP address of your
machine. You will find the advertisement section in the dashboard interface of the installer. Just click on the "Network" adapters
that you want to advertise the platform on. When in doubt just click on all of them.

:::note About Advertising

Advertising the platform on your local network is a great way to make it discoverable for other users and apps, and we spent *a lot of time*
to make this work. It is however not a foolproof method and might not work in all cases. If you encounter problems with the advertisement
of the platform, please consult the [Troubleshooting section](/docs/troubleshooting/startup) for more information.

## Other installation strategies

Here we will describe other installation strategies that you can use to install the platform. These strategies are not
recommended for beginners, but might be useful if you want to integrate the platform in a larger infrastructure or if
you want to participate in the development of the platform.

### Docker-Compose

If you are familiar with docker-compose, you can use the docker-compose configuration to set up the platform. We maintain
an active repository with the docker-compose configuration that you can find [here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-server).
This includes already the configuration for the most common modules of the platform, and when cloned with the submodules
(`git clone --recurse-submodules`) will also include the source code of the platform. If you encounter any problems with
the docker-compose configuration, please open an issue in the repository.


### Helm Charts

We are currently working on a helm chart that will allow you to install arkitekt on a kubernetes cluster. This will be
available soon. You will find the repository [here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/arkitekt-helm). For now, you can use the
docker-compose configuration to set up the platform on a kubernetes cluster using the [kompose](https://kompose.io/) tool.

### Custom installation

From here be dragons. You can find some hints in the  developer section of each module and consult each sub
modules documentation for more information about the installation of the platform. At this point however you are on your
own. If you encounter any problems, please open an issue in the respective repository.
