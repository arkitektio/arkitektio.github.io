## Introduction

This section will cover some more advanced topics, and illustrate how to use Arkitekt for some more involved use cases.
Use cases that actually warrent the use of a tool like Arkitekt.

:::note

This section assumes that you have read the [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/first_steps/) section, and that you have a basic understanding of how Arkitekt works.
If you feel like the tutorial is moving too fast, or you are not sure what is going on, please tell us. We are always looking for ways to improve the tutorial.

## The use cases we will cover

- [ Arkitekt as a Deep Learning Bridge](/docs/introduction/advanced/deep_learning):

  Here we will cover how to use Arkitekt to utilize a Deep Learning App right in your favourite bioimage analysis
  app.

- [ Train a Deep Learning Model with Arkitekt](/docs/introduction/advanced/training):

  Here we will cover how to use Arkitekt to train a Deep Learning Model. We will use the same algorithm as in the
  previous section, but this time we will train it.

- [ Arkitekt for Live Analysis](/docs/introduction/advanced/live):

  Here we will use Arkitekt to build our first real-time analysis pipeline. No more batches. We will use
  Arkitekt to build a pipeline that will analyze images as they are acquired.
