# Welcome to the Arkitekt Design Docs

This is the home of the Arkitekt design docs. Here you will find the information you need to understand how Arkitekt works under the hood and
what design decisions have been made. This should help you understand how to use Arkitekt and how to potentially contribute to the project.

## Under Construction

This is a work in progress. We are working on adding more content to this section. If you have any questions, please contact us directly.
Until then and if you are inclined also feel free to consult the [PhD thesis](/thesis.pdf), which contains a lot of information about the design of Arkitekt.
