# The Why Not? Series

The Why Not? series is a collection of articles that explain why Arkitekt does not support certain features or tries to justify why it does things in a certain way. The series is meant to be a collection of articles that explain the design decisions behind Arkitekt, comparing it to other tools and explaining why Arkitekt does things differently.

## What "Why Not?" is not

"Why Not?" is not a series of articles that explain why Arkitekt is better than other tools. It is not meant to be a series of articles that explain why other tools are bad. It just stands more as collection of thoughts and ideas that explain why Arkitekt is the way it is.

:::note

We would love to hear your thoughts and ideas. Really!
