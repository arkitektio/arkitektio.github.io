# The Vs Series

The Why Not? series is a collection of articles that explain how Arkitekt compares to other tools that are used for similar purposes. The series is meant to be a collection of articles that explain the design decisions behind Arkitekt, comparing it to other tools and explaining why Arkitekt does things differently

## What Vs is not

"Vs" is not a series of articles that explain why Arkitekt is better than other tools. It is not meant to be a series of articles that explain why other tools are bad. It just stands more as collection of thoughts and ideas that explain why Arkitekt is the way it is.

:::note

You disagree with a description illustrated in the "Vs" series? You think we misrepresent a tool? You think that Arkitekt should do things differently? We would love your feedback and insight about the topic. Please, please please open a discussion on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/arkitektio/discussions) page. We would love to hear your thoughts and ideas. Really!
