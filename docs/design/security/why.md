# Why should I care about security?

Security is a very important part of Arkitekt. We have put a lot of effort into making sure that Arkitekt is secure, and we will continue to do so. So why should you care about security? Well, there are a few reasons:

- **You don't want your data to be stolen**. If you are using Arkitekt to store your data, you probably don't want anyone else to be able to access it. Arkitekt is designed to make sure that your data is safe, but you still need to make sure that you are using it in a secure way. If you are not, you might end up with your data being stolen.
