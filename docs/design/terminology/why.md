# Why do I have to learn these words?

While developing Arkitekt, we have found ourselves in the position of having to explain the same concepts over and over again. And while we are happy to do that, we also want to make sure that we are not wasting your time. So we decided to create a list of terms that we use in Arkitekt, and explain them in a way that we hope is easy to understand. If you are new to Arkitekt, we recommend that you take a look at this list before you start reading the rest of the documentation, as they will help you understand the rest of the documentation better, and guide you in the right direction. 

If you feel like we have missed something, or if you have a suggestion for a better explanation, please let us know by creating an issue on our [Github repository](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/doks/) (or just edit the file and create a pull request). 

## Before we start

This document assumes that you have a basic understanding of what arkitekt is, and what it is used for. If you don't, we recommend that you take a look at the [Introduction](/docs/introduction) page.

## A short visual guide

We have created a short visual guide to help you understand the concepts that we use in Arkitekt. It is not meant to be a complete guide, but rather a quick overview of the concepts that we use in Arkitekt. Just click on one of the items to be guided to the corresponding section in this document.

If you have no idea what we are talking about, we recommend that you start with the [What is an App?](/docs/design/terminology/app.md) section.
