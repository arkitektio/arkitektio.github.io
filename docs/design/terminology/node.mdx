## What is a node?

Nodes are a core conceptual element of the arkitekt platform, that represent the
functionality that Arkitekt can do for you. As such you can think of a node as a provider of a bioimage task.

E.g. a node can be a functionality provided by an app that maximum projects an image, or applies a gaussian filter
to an image, but also a functionality that will ask you the user to select a file, or label an image. A node can
therefore be anything that you can envision as a task.

## Input and Output

Nodes in Arkitekt are defined by their input and output. This means that a node can be a simple as a node that
takes an image as an input and outputs an image, or more complex as a node that two images and some information
about the images as an input and outputs a table of results.

## What is a node not?

The most important feature to understand about Arkitekt nodes is that they are not bound to an implementation.

<div className="mt-2">
<Image img={node_template} />

<div className="text-gray-400 mb-2">
<small>Arkitekts nodes and templates</small>
</div>
</div>

This means that a node can be implemented in many different ways **AND**, by various different apps.
For example, here the show Node is implemented by the Fiji app, but also by the Napari app. These apps
can implement the same node in different ways, as long as they respect the input and output and the general
logic of the node. As nodes are the primary way to interact with the platform, this means that you can
rest assured that the node will behave the same way, no matter which app implements it, but also that
you can choose the app that you like the most.

:::note
Also this abstraction, comes with some additional benefits for the application developer as they can use this
abstraction to automatically test their app against the node specification. More about this in the developer
sections. As apps templates are the primary way to interact with the platform, this means that even though part
of their code can change each version, but users can still interface with the app in the same way, until the developer
decides to change the input and output of the node.

## Node can establish Streams

Another important feature to understand about Arkitekt nodes is how they process data. This section will only
make sense if you have read the Workflow section, but it is important to understand how nodes can establish
streams of data.

## Programming Analogy

Everybody knows and loves functions, especially functional programming friends like us. If you are
are familiar with the core concepts of function and generators in programming, then have a look at their
analogy in Arkitekt.
