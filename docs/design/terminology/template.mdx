# What is a Template?

Templates can be best understood in comparison with nodes. A node in Arkitekt is an abstract description of an analysis tasks, which defines
the inputs, outputs, but **not** the actual code that is run. A template is a concrete implementation of a node, and maps the abstract
notion of the task to a real world implementation.

Apps therefore do not expose nodes, but templates. So when trying to run an analysis and instructing Arktiekt to run a task, Arkitekt internally
looks up the template that is associated with the node, and sends the request to the app that is associated with the template.

## Example

Let's say you have want to do a bioimage task that is called "Project Maximum Intensity". This tasks has exactly on input, such as an image, and a single output, the segmented image Thats the abstract description of the task, and is represented by a node in Arkitekt. 
Now this tasks could run on a variety of different applications, such as on ImageJ, Stardist or Napari. 
Each of these applications would have a different way of running the task, but the abstract idea including the inputs and outputs would be the same.
 These different ways of running the task are represented by templates in Arkitekt.


<div className="mt-2">
<Image img={template} />

<div className="text-gray-400 mb-2">
<small>Nodes and Templates</small>
</div>
</div>

Nodes are never attached to an application, templates always are. 

:::info 

Importantly templates are not created only on the app level, but for each user that runs the app. This allows us to find the best fitting
template for each bioimage task.

## Developer Side 

When developing an app, you will never really interact with nodes and templates, as they are abstract concepts that are abstracted away by our SDKs. 
Once you register a python function, that function will be automatically inspected to infer inputs and outputs and the documentaiton of the function.
This information is now send to the Arkitekt server, and if no node with the parameters of the function exists, a new node is automatically created and
associated with the app.
