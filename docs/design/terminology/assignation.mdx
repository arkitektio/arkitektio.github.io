### Whats is a port?

A port is concept tightligly related to Nodes and their input and outputs.
Each nodes has multiple input and output ports.

Ports are defined by a mandatory `key` and a `type` and an optional `label`.

```javascript
{
  key: 'input',
  type: 'number',
  label: 'Input'
}
```

### Port Types

Each port has a type, that defines the type of data that can be passed through it.
The following basic types are supported:

- `int`
- `float`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `structure`

Additionality there are some special types:

- `List` - A list of values of the same type
- `Dict` - A key-value pair of values of the same type
- `Union` - A value that can be one of multiple types

Importantly Ports always specifie if they expect nullable values or not.

:::note

Structure Ports are a bit special. They are used to define non
serializable data structures, that need to be shrank down to a serializable
format, and expanded back to the original format, when passing from
one app to another app.
