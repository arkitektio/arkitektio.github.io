# Port

Port is Arkitekts "App Store" for all the apps that can run as Plugins on the Platform, so called
PluginApps. It allows you to install
and manage these as containerized applications on the Platform and to execute them directly on the
Platform server.

:::note

While the Port service is a core part of the Platform, we are currently rethinking the way we want
to handle the execution of PluginApps. In the future we think that the "Kabinet" service will be
responsible for the execution of PluginApps. YOu can read more about Kabinet [here](/docs/services/next/kabinet).
