# Rekuest

Rekuest is one of the core services of Arkitekt. It represents a central repository of
all the connected apps and their provided functionality, their [Nodes](/docs/design/terminology/node).
It also provides ways of interacting with the apps, by providing a central access point, that
apps and users can assign tasks to. Rekuest then takes care of routing the requests to the
appropriate app, which executres the task and returns the result to rekuest, which in turn routes it back
to the caller. Similar to all other Arkitekt ervices, Rekuest exposes a GraphQL API, that can be used to interact with it.
You can find the interactive documentation for the API [here](/explorer).

## Rekuest Design

Rekuest itself is designed as a stateless service (in order to be able to scale horizontally), and
interfaces with proven open-source technologies, such as [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
to route tasks to the appropriate apps. The following diagram shows the high-level design of Rekuest:

:::note

Rekuest is currently being rewritten to support other message brokers, such as [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/). This will
however remain an opt-in feature, and RabbitMQ will remain the default message broker. To learn more about this design decision,
please refer to the [Why Not?](/docs/design/why-not) section.

### Challenges as a Distributed System

Rekuest is our backbone service for the distributed task execution in Arkitekt. As such it has to be highly available and
fault-tolerant. This is a huge undertaking and we are still in the process of refining the design and implementation of Rekuest.

But luckily we are not alone in this. We are standing on the shoulders of giants, and we are using proven open-source technologies
to build Rekuest. This allows us to focus on the business logic and the integration with other Arkitekt services, and not have to worry
about the low-level details of distributed systems.

We tried to achieved this by using a message broker (RabbitMQ) to queue and distribute tasks to the appropriate apps,
and only thinly wrapping it in a websocket-based API. The sole purpose of this API is to provide a safe and interoperable way
to interact with Rekuest, and to provide a way to monitor the state of the system.
