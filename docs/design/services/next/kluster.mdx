# Kluster

Kluster is a DASK Cluster Manager Gateway that interfaces with Dask-Gateway to provide on demand
scalable Dask Clusters on a variety of underlying distributed computing platforms (SLURM, PBS,
Kubernetes, Hadooop).


<GithubRepo url="https://github.com/arkitektio/kluster-server" title="Kluster"/>

## Design

Kluster is designed to be a stateless gateway that interfaces with the [Dask-Gateway](https://gateway.dask.org/) 
and only provide a more documentated GraphQL API inline with the Arkitekt design principles. Additionally to the main 
Kluster Server we also provide a modified Dask-Gateway [Kluster-Gateway] that comes with a JWT Authentication plugin
so that Arkitekts Authentication paradigm can be used to authenticate users to the Dask-Gateway, when not using the
Kluster Server.

:::info

Currently Kluster is in the early stages of development and has not been tested with all Cluster Backends,
that Dask-Gateway can provide for. It works great with Local Clusters and SLURM Clusters (albeit SlURM requires
some additional configuration).If you have been using Dask-Gateway and have a use case for Kluster, please
reach out to us and we can help you get started.
