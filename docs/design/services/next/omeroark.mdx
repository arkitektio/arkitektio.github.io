# OmeroArk

OmeroArk is a tool for managing and archiving data from OMERO. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the OMERO server, 
and provides a familiar GraphQL API for querying and managing data on the Omero server.

# Design

OmeroArk is designed to be a stateless gateway that wraps the Blitz based Omero-Server in a more documentated GraphQL API inline with the Arkitekt design principles.

:::info

While we are exploring to make this GraphQL API more powerful and to facilitate the download of
raw data from the OMERO server, because of limitations in the Blitz Gateway, the Graphql API is currently not allowing the upload of data to the OMERO server.
(Similar to the OMERO web client, where also upload is not possible).

# Features

- **GraphQL API**: OmeroArk provides a familiar (http based) GraphQL API for querying and managing data on the Omero server.
- **Stateless Gateway**: OmeroArk is designed to be a stateless gateway and does not need to sync data with the OMERO server. What you see is what you
    get from the OMERO server.

- **Authentication** OmeroArk uses the same SSO authentication like the rest of the Arktiekt Platform. Once you have associated your omero account with your Arkitekt account.
