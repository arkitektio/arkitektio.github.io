# Fluss

Fluss is the Arkitekt service for managing the design of workflows and their runs. It provides the storage
backend for importing and exporting workflows, and acts as the log service for workflow runs.

:::info

Fluss is not a workflow engine. It does not execute workflows, but rather manages their data for design and runs.
Workflow execution in an Arkitekt system is handled by `Apps` not `Services`. To read more about Scheduling
Apps and their execution, see the [Workflow](/docs/workflow) documentation.

## The Workflow Format

A Workflow that is designed by a user (in an App like Orkestrator) is stored in Fluss in a plain JSON format.
This JSON format contains the definition of the worklflow by defining the nodes and their connections. While
you can manipulate this JSON directly, the JSON format is not primarily designed for human readability. Instead,
please use the Orkestrator App to design and manage workflows.

We also provide webcomponents that allow you to render the workflow in a visual format. This is useful for
displaying the workflow in a user interface (just like here in the documentation).


## Workflow Runs

When a workflow is executed by an App, the App will create a new `Run` in Fluss. This run will contain the log
of all the events that occur during the execution of the workflow. This log is stored in Fluss and can be queried
by any app. While these logs provide a detailed view of the logical execution of the workflow, they do not contain
all the details for provenance reasons. For example (quite obviously) the logs do not contain the actual data that was processed
by the workflow. Instead, the logs contain references to the data, and the data is stored in the storage service. However
they do contain the details of the processing steps that were applied to the data.

Because a normal workflow can be quite complex, the logs can be quite large. Fluss lets you filter the logs by time,
by node, by status, and by other criteria, and with Orkestrator you can view the logs in a visual format.
