# Services

Arkitekt is designed to be a flexible and modular platform that can stand as a central backbone for a wide variety of biological analysis needs in lab.
This modularity and composability of the platform is ensured by the use of a (micro)-service architecture, where each service is designed to be a standalone 
component that can be used independently or in combination with other services. A service in the Arkitekt platform is a containerized web-server that can be
provides API endpoints for its functionality.





## Services in Arkitekt

The following are the core services that are installed in a default Arkitekt platform:

- [Lok](services/lok): Authorization and Authentication service
- [Rekuest](services/rekuest): Node Repository and Task-Assignment
- [Port](services/port): Virtualizion of plugin apps
- [Mikro](services/mikro): Microscopy Data Management
- [Fluss](services/fluss): Workflow management

Other services can be added to the platform as needed. Some additional services that are available in the Arkitekt platform are:

- [OmeroArk](services/next/omeroark): OMERO integration
- [Kluster](services/next/kluster): Dask-Cluster management
- [Kabinet](services/next/kabinet): Next genration Plugin Management


## Technical Design of the Services

#### Design Principles

While the Services in Arkitekt can be designed in a variety of ways, the following are some of the key design principles that are followed in the design of the services:

- **Containerized**: Each service is designed to be a containerized web-server that can be deployed in a containerized environment (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes).

- **GraphQL API**: Each service provides a GraphQL API that can be used to interact with the service. This allows for a flexible and powerful way to interact with the service.

- **No inter-service communication**: While Arkitekt adopts a clear seperation of concerns and modularity in its design, the services are designed to act completely independently and do not
communicate with each other (as opposed to some micro-service architectures where services communicate with each other). This is to ensure that the services
can develop and evolve independently and can be used in a variety of combinations.

- ** JWT Authentication and Authorization**: Each service can be configured to use a variety of authentication and authorization mechanisms. However, In order to ensure a consistent and distibributed authentication 
each service accepts JWT tokens that are used to authenticate.

- **Database**: Each service can be configured to use a variety of databases. However, the default database used in the Arkitekt platform is a PostgreSQL database.

- **Configuration**: Each service should be configurable using a configuration file and environment variables. This configuration is generated when installaling the platform
through the Arkitekt CLI or Konstruktor.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Each service logs its activity to standard output. 

#### Current Tech Stack

The following are the current base technologies that are used in the design of the services:

- **Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Django
- **GraphQL**: Graphene
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

While the above technologies are used as the base, the services can be designed using a variety of technologies and frameworks as needed.

:::note

In an effort to standardize and make the backend services more testable and type-safe, we are currently in the process of migrating the services
to use `Strawberry` a wildely used Python GraphQL library that is designed to be more type-safe and testable.

:::info

While Django might not be the most performant web-framework, it is chosen as the base web-framework for the services due to its flexibility,
modularity and the wide variety of libraries and tools that are available for it. If you are designing a service that requires high-performance
or has specific requirements, you can choose to use a different web-framework.
