# On Premise

On Premise is the installation of the software on your own server / computer. It is at the moment our prefered way of
installing and testing our Arkitekt. While it is not as comfy as using an already hosted service, it is currently the
only way to use the full power of Arkitekt.

When installing on premise, you can choose from a variety of different installation methods. We will cover the most
common ones here.
