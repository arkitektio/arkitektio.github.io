## Development

Facilitating a  smooth development process is one of the main goals of Arkitekt. To achieve this, we have created a
development environment that allows you to test your App in a real environment and against a real Arkitekt Server,
all from within your python Code.

:::warning

While the development environment is probably the easiest way to deploy an Arkitket Server for every Python developer,
we would not recommend it when serving your App. The development environment is not optimized for performance and
security and should only be used for development purposes.

### Staring a Development Server

To start a development server from within your Python Code, you can use the 'deployment' function from the 'arkitekt'
package. In its simplest form, the function takes the following arguments:

```python
from arkitekt import deployment

my_deployment = deployment("my_deployment", channel="stable")

```

The first argument is the name of your deployment. It will be used to create a folder in a ".dokker" folder in your
working directory. The second argument is the channel you want to use. The channel determines which version of the
Arkitekt Server will be used. The default channel is "stable", but you can also use "latest" or "next" to use other 
versions.

The deployment function will return a Deployment object. This object has a number of methods that allow you to interact
with the deployment. The most important ones are:

- `up()`: Starts the deployment
- `down()`: Stops the Deployment

Because we want to guarentee that the deployment is stopped when the Python process is terminated, we necessiate using
the `with` statement when using the deployment:

```python

from arkitekt import deployment

with deployment("my_deployment", channel="stable") as d:
    # Do something with the deployment
    d.up(wait_for_health=True)

    print("Deployment is running")
    pass

```

<small> An example of how you might version an Arkitekt Deployment depending on your needs. Generally you will want most of your apps to connect to stable
services. The only "conserved" platform api for the platform is the fakts api, which will not be able to differ from app to app that connects to your deployment.
It is the defining service for each deployment.  </small>

Testing your App is an important part of the development process. It helps to ensure that the code is working as expected 
and that it is not breaking any existing functionality. While unit-testing your code is far more important, we also wanted
you to be able to test your App in a real environment and gainst a real Arkitekt Server.
