allows you to create your first Deployment in a few minutes, helping you to autoconfigure some of the more complex settings.

:::note

Konstruktor is our prefered tool for creating and managing Deployments. As it allows us to provide you with a better experience
when checking your Deployment for errors and warnings. It also allows us to provide you with a better experience when it comes
to updating your Deployment.
