# KraphQL

Arkitekt comes with experimental support for KraphQL, which is an extension of GraphQL syntax that allows you to query data through an GraphQL Api call and
allows you to describe the data of your plots in a declarative way.
This is useful for building dashboards and other applications that need to display live data.
