# Lazy Loading 

Lazy loading is a design pattern primarily used in software programming and web development.
Its main purpose is to delay the initialization or loading of an object or a resource until it's actually needed. 
Arkitekt makes heavy use of lazy loading to keep the memory and network footprint of the applications as small as possible.
