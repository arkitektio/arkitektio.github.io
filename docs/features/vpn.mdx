## Introduction

Arkitekt is not an entirely secure system, just yet. So if you want to use some of the arguably more interesting features of
Arkitekt like online monitoring and remote control, you should consider using a VPN, to secure your connection.

## I don't have a VPN

No, this is not a NordVPN ad. And we are not going to recommend any specific VPN solution. There are plenty of them out there,
and you can find a lot of reviews and comparisons online. We would however try to steer you away from the online VPN services,
that advertised all over the place. They are usually not very secure, and you are the product, not the customer. If your university
VPN is shit, we can however recommend a pretty straightforward solution, that is easy to set up and use and can easily
coexist with other VPNs you might be using: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)( It's what we have been using to enable remote
monitoring)

:::caution This is not open source software

While big parts of the Tailscale software are open source, some of the core components are not. Tailscale is a commercial product,
that is free for personal use.
