# Welcome 

Welcome to the Arkitekt Showcase and interactive documentation to help you run the Arkitekt workflows,
that are described in the Arkitekt publication. Before you try to recreate the illustrated three
workflows, we strongly encourage you to follow the first steps tutorial to get familiar with the 
plaform and some of the Arkitekt features. This documentation will make more sense if you have
a basic understanding of the Arkitekt platform.

## Tested Environment

To most closely reproduce the workflows, we have listed the software versions that were used to 
generate the results. We have also listed the hardware on the machine that was used to run the
Arkitekt server for workflow I and III. Additionally, we have listed the hardware setup of the "parallization"
computers run the Arkitekt server for workflow II.

### Software

The following Arkitekt and other software versions were used to run the workflows

# Arkitekt Deployment

Arkitekt Admin Tool: Konstruktor (v.0.0.6)
Arkitekt Server: Arkitekt ("paper" channel)
Arkitekt Web Interface: Orkestrator (v.0.0.6)

# App versions

App versions are listed in the "Participating Apps" section of each workflow.

# Docker, Drivers, and OS

Workflows were tested both on Arkitekt installed both on a Windows and Linux Machine.
The following base configuration
was used

### Linux

Docker Desktop: 24.0.6
Nvidia-Drivers: 535.113
CUDA: 12.2
Ubuntu: 22.04.3 LTS

### Windows 

Docker Desktop: 22.0.6
Nvidia-Drivers: 535.113 # TODO check
