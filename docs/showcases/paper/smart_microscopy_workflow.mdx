Arkitekt was designed for the increasingly complex real-time microscopy workflows of today.
To illustrate Arkitekt readiness for `Smart Microscopy`, we deviced this simply no-code example
of a `Smart Microscopy` workflow to perform the 3D live monitoring of cell
clusters with a 40X objective, while scanning a large field of view with a 20X objective. 

In this workflow, the Micro-Manager open-source software (Edelstein et al. 2014) is setup for a
multidimensional acquisition. The user then interactively sets up a grid of positions on large sample
area (2.61mm x 2.61mm, corresponding to 4*4 stage positions) containing living fluorescent 
cells. 

During the workflow defined positions are then acquired at 20X magnification every 30 minutes for 24 hours. 
For every acquired 20X magnification image, nuclei are then automatically segmented on a remote
computer using the Stardist (Weigert et al. 2020) algorithm, and cell clusters are computed with the help of 
DBSCAN (Ester et al. 1996).
When one or more of such identified clusters are detected, the ROIs central coordinates and
dimensions are translated back to stage coordinates and sent back to the microscope. 3D stacks
of these positions (25 planes, 0.5Âµm step size) are then collected at higher magnification
(40X) on a well-adjusted cameroa ROI fitting the cell clusters size. After all the positive events are
detected, acquired in 3D high-resolution and displayed on the web-interface, the next image
is acquired at 20X magnification

### Prerequisites

:::tip Please read 

We **strongly** suggest to go through the [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/first_steps) guide before attempting to run this workflow.
It will guide you through the installation of the Arkitekt platform and the setup of your first workflow, as well as how to install plugins
and apps.
:::

This workflow is designed to run on a microscope computer running Windows 10 as well as on a remote analysis computer 
that will power the Arkitekt platform and the image analysis. To enable GPU acceleration for the Stardist
segmentation, the analysis computer needs to have access to a CUDA 11 enabled GPU (tested on Nvidia GeforceRTX 2080Ti).
The microscope computer will need to be connected to thevthe same network as the remote computer.

Additionally to run this workflow you will need to have the following installed on your microscope computer:

- [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) (version 2.0.1 2023.05.23 (later versions might work as well))
- [MikroManager](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro-manager) (version 0.0.1) [Download here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro-manager/releases/tag/6589964173)

As well as the following plugins installed on your Arkitekt computer:

- Stdlib Plugin (version 0.3.6) from the repository [https://github.com/jhnnsrs/stdlib](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/stdlib)
- Segmentor Plugin (version 0.3.1 ) from the repository [https://github.com/jhnnsrs/segmentor](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/segmentor)

### Installing the Workflows

This workflow is composed of two workflows, with one workflow being nested in the other. The first workflow is the
`acquire_small` workflow, which is the workflow that will acquire a 20X Image, segment it, detect cluster and send the coordinates
to the microscope to acquire all clusters with a 40X objective. The second workflow is the `acquire_large` workflow, which is the
workflow that will run this workflow in a multidimensional acquistions for all position every 30 minutes for 24 hours.

To install these workflows connect this website to you Arkitekt instance and click on the button below:
