To illustrate Arkitekt readiness for Smart Microscopy, a simple but powerful no-code example
of a Smart Microscopy workflow was designed to perform the 3D live monitoring of cell
clusters with a 40X objective, while scanning a large field of view with a 20X objective. In this
workflow, the Micro-Manager open-source software (Edelstein et al. 2014) was used for the
multidimensional acquisition. The user interactively set up a grid of positions on large sample
area (2.61mm x 2.61mm, corresponding to 4*4 stage positions) containing living fluorescent 
cells placed under an inverted microscope, with a 20X magnification objective. All the defined
positions were then acquired at 20X magnification every 30 minutes for 24 hours. For every
acquired 20X magnification image, nuclei were automatically segmented on a remote
computer using Stardist (Weigert et al. 2020) algorithm, and cell clusters computed with
DBSCAN algorithms (Ester et al. 1996) with certain properties were identified and marked.
When one or more of such identified clusters were detected, the ROIs central coordinates and
dimensions were translated to stage coordinates and sent back to the microscope. 3D stacks
of these positions (25 planes, 0.5Âµm step size) were then collected at higher magnification
(40X) on a well-adjusted ROI fitting the cell clusters size. After all the positive events were
detected, acquired in 3D high-resolution and displayed on the web-interface, the next image
was acquired at 20X magnification
