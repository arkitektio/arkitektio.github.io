Arkitekt was designed for the increasingly complex real-time microscopy workflows of today.
To illustrate Arkitekt readiness for `Smart Microscopy`, we deviced this simply no-code example
of a `Smart Microscopy` workflow to perform the 3D live monitoring of cell
clusters with a 40X objective, while scanning a large field of view with a 20X objective.

In this workflow, the Micro-Manager open-source software (Edelstein et al. 2014) is setup for a
multidimensional acquisition. The user then interactively sets up a grid of positions on large sample
area (2.61mm x 2.61mm, corresponding to 4\*4 stage positions) containing living fluorescent
cells.

During the workflow defined positions are then acquired at 20X magnification every 30 minutes for 24 hours.
For every acquired 20X magnification image, nuclei are then automatically segmented on a remote
computer using the Stardist (Weigert et al. 2020) algorithm, and cell clusters are computed with the help of
DBSCAN (Ester et al. 1996).
When one or more of such identified clusters are detected, the ROIs central coordinates and
dimensions are translated back to stage coordinates and sent back to the microscope. 3D stacks
of these positions (25 planes, 0.5Âµm step size) are then collected at higher magnification
(40X) on a well-adjusted cameroa ROI fitting the cell clusters size. After all the positive events are
detected, acquired in 3D high-resolution and displayed on the web-interface, the next image
is acquired at 20X magnification

### Prerequisites

:::tip Please read

We **strongly** suggest to go through the [Getting Started](/docs/introduction/first_steps) guide before attempting to run this workflow.
It will guide you through the installation of the Arkitekt platform and the setup of your first workflow, as well as how to install plugins
and apps.
:::

This workflow is designed to run on a microscope computer running Windows 10 as well as on a remote analysis computer
that will power the Arkitekt platform and the image analysis. To enable GPU acceleration for the Stardist
segmentation, the analysis computer needs to have access to a CUDA 11 enabled GPU (tested on Nvidia GeforceRTX 2080Ti).
The microscope computer will need to be connected to the same network as the remote computer.

#### Acquisition Computer

Additionally to run this workflow you will need to have the following installed on your microscope computer:

- [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) (version 2.0.1 2023.05.23 (later versions might work as well))
- [MikroManager](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro-manager) (version 0.0.1) [Download here](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/mikro-manager/releases/latest)

As well as the following plugins installed on your Arkitekt computer:

- Reaktor Plugin (>=0.0.3) from the repository [https://github.com/jhnnsrs/reaktor](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/reaktor)
- Stdlib Plugin (>=version 0.3.10) from the repository [https://github.com/jhnnsrs/stdlib](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/stdlib)
- Segmentor Plugin (>version 0.3.4 ) from the repository [https://github.com/jhnnsrs/segmentor](https://github.com/jhnnsrs/segmentor)

## Installing the Workflows

This Smart Microscopy workflow is composed of two smaller workflows, the `Acquire Clusters` workflow and the `Multi Dimensional` workflow.
In Which the `Acquire Clusters` workflow will be nested in the `Multi Dimensional` workflow.

### Acquire Clusters Workflow

The `Acquire Clusters` workflow is the workflow that will acquire a 20X Image, segment it, detect cluster and send the coordinates
to the microscope to acquire all clusters with a 40X objective. To install this workflow connect this website to you Arkitekt instance and click on the Import buttom below:

<DisplayWorkflow flow={acquireSmallWorkflow} />

A few things to note about this workflow:

1. This workflow utilizes a pretrained Stardist model to segment the nuclei in the image. This model comes preinstalled with the Segmentor plugin, by changing this node
   with a `Predict Stardist` node you can use your own Stardist model.

2. The parameters to the Cell Cluster Detection are Global Variables of the Workflow

### Deploying the Workflow

During the Deployment of the smaller workflow it is imperative that you name the workflow `Acquire Clusters` as this and the parameters of the workflow will be used by the `Multi Dimensional` workflow,
to adequately detect the workflow. If you choose to name the workflow differently you will need to change the respective `Acquire Clusters` node in the `Multi Dimensional` workflow.
You do not need to reserve this workflow, as it will be reserved by the `Multi Dimensional` workflow.

:::note 

This imperative naming need is a current bug and will be fixed in a future release of Arkitekt.

:::

### Multi Dimensional Workflow

The `Multi Dimensional` workflow is the workflow that will run the above workflow in a multidimensional acquistions for all position every X minutes for X hours.

    Once connected this pane will also give you an overview over the apps that
    still need to be installed, nodes in green have been installed, nodes in
    yellow still lack an implementation. Of course feel free to explore this
    graph more interactively in your orkestrator interface
