# Welcome

Welcome to the Arkitekt Paper Showcase and interactive documentation to help you run the Arkitekt workflows,
that are described in the Arkitekt publication. Before you try to recreate the illustrated three
workflows, we strongly encourage you to follow the [first steps](/docs/introduction/first_steps) tutorial to get familiar with the
plaform and some of the Arkitekt features. This documentation will make more sense if you have
a basic understanding of the Arkitekt platform.

## Tested Environments

To most closely reproduce the workflows, we have listed the software versions that were used to
generate the results. We have also listed the hardware and outside software dependencies that were
used to run the workflows.
