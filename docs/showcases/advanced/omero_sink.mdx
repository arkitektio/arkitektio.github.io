## Omero Integration

Arkitekt can be deployed to work with Omero, a popular open source image management platform. Through this integration you
can easily create workflows that interact with Omero, for example to upload images to Omero or to download images
from Omero.

:::note
This integration is currently in beta and provides a limited set of features. We are working on expanding the
integration to cover more of the Omero API. If you have any feedback or requests, please let us know.
:::

## Setting up the Omero integration

To use the Omero integration, you need to use a Arkitekt instance that has the Omero integration enabled. Arkitekt
deployments, that use Konstruktor can enable the Omero integration by choosing an "beta" channel and enabling Omero
in the setup process. You will be also asked if you want to *include* a dedicated Omero setup in your deployment, or
if you want to *connect* to an existing Omero instance. When enabling the OMERO integration, your Arkitekt deployment
will include an additional (micro-) service: Omero-Ark, which will act as a proxy between your Arkitekt apps and Omero.

:::warning

In this beta, we *highly* recommend to use the dedicated Omero setup. The Omero integration is still in beta and
might not work with all Omero instances. If you want to connect to an existing Omero instance, please make sure that
you are using a recent version of Omero (>= 5.6.0) and that your Omero instance is accessible from the Arkitekt
deployment.

:::


## Connecting to an existing Omero instance

If your deployment supports OMERO Orkestrator will automatically create a new pane
in the sidebar, that allows you to connect to an existing Omero instance.

On first setup, you will need to provide the URL of your Omero instance and your credentials, for your Omero account.
You can also provide a name for the connection, that will be used to identify the connection in the sidebar. Without 
a name, the connection will be identified by the URL of the Omero instance.


## Using the Omero integration

Once you have connected to an Omero instance, you can use the full featureset of the Arkitekt platfrom with your Omero
data. You can explore your data, create workflows that interact with your data and interconvert your data between mikro
and Omero.

:::note

In this current beta, we focused on integrating OMERO as a data source and target for workflows. While we are working on
integrating more of the OMERO ecoyste, we currently do not plan to establish OMERO as a data `backbone` for Arkitekt, as it is
not really optimized for high throughput data processing and streaming data. If you are interested in using OMERO as a data backbone for
your Arkitekt instance, please let us know.

## Uploading data to Omero

OMEROs integration of new image datasets is based on the concept of `projects`. Projects are collections of datasets, that
can be shared with other users.
