Orkestrator is not working for you? Here are some tips to help you troubleshoot.



## Reload, Restart

If Orkestrator is not working, feels slughish and unresponsive, try refreshing the page in your browser or right click on an empty part of the main view, to 
bring up the context menu and select `Reload` in the Desktop App. You will be surprised how often this fixes the problem. If reloading does not help,
try restarting Orkestrator. Sometimes, the app gets stuck in a bad state and needs to be restarted. 


## My Tool Reservation is not working

If you have a reservation for a node that is not working, and you can't assign to the node, here are some tips to help you troubleshoot.

1. Reload the page:

    Easy first. Try reloading the page. This might fix the problem.

2. Check if the app is offline.

    It might just be that the app is offline, and there is nothing wrong. Can you see it active in the `Active Apps` section in the Dashboard?
    If its not listed here, it might be offline. Try connecting, restarting the app or the plugin.

3. Bounce the linked App:

    If it appears it try to give it a little nudge to update its state. Select the `Bounce` Action in the Action Menu of the App. This will briefly disconnect the App and reconnect it.
    This might fix the problem.

4. Inspect the Reservation:

    Each reservation should be linked to at least on App through a `Provision`. To inspect the linked App click on the Reservation in the 
    Dashboard and then inspect the `Linked Provisions` . Check if at least one of the linked provisions is in the `Active` state. 

5.  Re-reserve the node:

    If the App is working, but the reservation is still not working, or for some reason you have no linked App, try unreserving (ie. deleting) the reservation and
    reserving the node again. This should fix the problem.

6.  Delete the Node:

    If all of this fails you can try to delete the node and re-add it. Just delete the node in its detail view, and restart the app,
    it should re-add the node. Re-reserve the node and it should work again.


## My Workflow Reservation is not working

If you have a reservation for a workflow that is not working, and you can't assign to the workflow, here are some tips to help you troubleshoot.

1. Reload the page:

    Easy first. Try reloading the page. This might fix the problem.


2. Inspect the Reservation:

    Your reservation should be linked to a `Provision` on the `Scheduler` app. Click on that provision and inspect the `Workflow`in the detail view.
    This will show all the reservations for the workflow. Check if all the reservation are in the `Active` state. If not check that reservation and 
    restart the app. This should fix the problem and update the workflow. If you don't see any change, try to reload the page.


3. Check if the Scheduler is offline:

    If you can't see the Scheduler in the `Active Apps` section in the Dashboard, it might be offline. If so, try restarting the app or the plugin.

4.  Re-reserve the workflow:

    If the Scheduler is working, but the reservation is still not working, or for some reason you have no linked Scheduler, try unreserving (ie. deleting) the reservation and
    reserving the workflow again. This should fix the problem.
