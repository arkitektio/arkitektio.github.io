# Gucker

Gucker (from German: "gucken" / to watch) is a file watcher that can be used to watch files and directories for changes and can stream the new files to the
Arkitekt Server. 

## Idea

Gucker was developed to enable directly streaming files that are being produced (by your microscope) to the Arkitekt Server and to directly start the processing
of the files in a workflow.

## Installation
