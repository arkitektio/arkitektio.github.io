# Gucker

Gucker (from German: "gucken" / to watch) is a file watcher that can be used to watch files and directories for changes and can stream the new files to the
Arkitekt Server. 

## Idea

Gucker was developed to enable directly streaming files that are being produced (by your microscope) to the Arkitekt Server and to directly start the processing
of the files in a workflow.

## Installation

Gucker comes as a bundled application installable from its Github Releases [page](https://github.com/arkitektio-apps/gucker/releases/latest).

Additionally you can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip install gucker
```

:::info On Mac support

Currently we provide no build for the Mac platform, but you can install it via pip on your Mac. We will add a Mac build in the future.

## Usage

Currently gucker is only available as a GUI while we are working on also enabling
it as a command line tool. To start the GUI simply run the binary in the extracted folder or run the following command, 
if you installed it via pip:

```bash
gucker
```

## Configuration

Gucker requires you to set two directories, the "Import" directory and the "Export" directory.
The "Import" directory is the directory that will be watched for changes 
while the "Target" directory is the directory where the files will be copied to when you explicitly export them.

## Usage in Arkitekt Workflows

Guckers main purpose is to establish a "Streaming Node" in Arkitekt workflows, and allows
you to directly stream files to the Arkitekt Server and start the processing of the files in a workflow.
For this just add the `Stream Files` node to your workflow and configure it to use the Gucker instance,
that points to the Folder you want to watch.

Additionally you can also specify some filters to only stream files that match a certain file pattern
in regexp. Here are some common patterns:

- `.*` - matches all files
- `.*.tif` - matches all tif files
- `.*.czi` - matches all czi files
- `.*.nd2` - matches all nd2 files
- `.*[.tif|.tiff]` - matches all jpg and png files

:::note

Regular expressions are a powerful tool to match file patterns, but can also be quite complex.
We are recommending to use a tool like [regex101](https://regex101.com/) to test your regular expressions. 
Against the files you want to match, if it gets too complex.
