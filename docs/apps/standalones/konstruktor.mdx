# Usage 

Please check our [Installation Guide](/docs/introduction/installation) for
instructions on how to install Arkitekt through Konstruktor.

# Design

Konstruktor is designed to be a simple and easy to use tool for managing your Arkitekt deployment, 
but can also be used to manage other software packages that need a more complex docker-compose setup.
We are working on making it more user friendly and adding more features to it, especially to make it
easier to install other open-source software packages like OMERO / Jupyterhub / Nextcloud / etc.
