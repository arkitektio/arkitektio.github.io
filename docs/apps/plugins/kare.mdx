## Kare

Kare is just CARE (content-aware restoration of fluorescence microscopy images) with a K and enabled as an Arkitekt Plugin.
When installing Kare, you can rely on two major features:

- **Training**: Train a CARE model using your own data.

- **Prediction**: Use a trained CARE model to restore images.

## Installation

To install Kare, you can use the Arkitekt Plugin Service "Port" to install it.

<InstallRepoButton repo="kare" user="arkitektio-apps" branch="master" />
