# Plugins

Plugins are [Apps] that are Apps that are able to run in a software container, and are designed to be more integrated into the Arkitekt Platform.
You can easily install them on the Arkitekt Server, without having to worry about the dependencies and requirements of the software.

Instead of providing their own User-Interface they hook into the Arkitekt Platform and provide a more seamless integration with the platform.

Currently we provide a few different plugins, that are community supported but feel free to create your own. We put a lot of effort in making this
as easy as possible, so if you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to us. To Create your own plugin, you can follow the [Plugin Creation Guide](/docs/developers/python/plugin).
