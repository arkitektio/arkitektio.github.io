# Mikro

Mikro is the Arkitekt go to solution for all things microscopy. It provides
the datamodels and services for managing microscopy data, and connects a binary
storage system around the [Minio](https://min.io/) object store, with a relational
database [Postgres](https://postgressql.org) for metadata storage.

As an API first system, Mikro provides a GraphQL API for all of its operations that
can be used by any client. It also provides a web based admin UI for interacting with
the system through a browser.

## Schema

The Mikro [schema](docs/features/graphql#schema) is the core of the system. It defines the data models and relationships
that are used to store and retrieve data. The schema is defined in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
and provides the only interface to the system. You can inspect a recent [schema.graphql](/schema.graphql)
Or you can use the [GraphQL Playground](http://localhost:8020/graphql) to interact with the system
directly.
