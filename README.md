# Arkitekt Documentation

This is the software repository for the documentation for the Arkitekt framework.
It is used to generate the static site that is hosted on GitHub Pages.

You can find the site at [https://arkitekt.live](https://arkitekt.live).

## Scope of this Repository and Documentation

This respository does **not** contain any platform specific code, but rather is used to
build the documentation website for the Arkitekt Platform. If you are interested in
exploring the associated projects of the platform please refer to the
[projects section](https://arkitekt.live/docs/developers/contribute/projects)

## Contributing to the Documentation

Thanks for considering this! By contributing to the documentation, you are helping to improve the Arkitekt Platform. The documentation is
hosted on GitHub Pages and is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

By default, the documentation is built and deployed automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch, and there
is no need to build the documentation locally. To contribute to a documentation page, simply press on "Edit this page" link
at the bottom of the page you want to edit. This will take you to the GitHub page for the documentation source file. You can
then edit the file and submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged into the documentation.
