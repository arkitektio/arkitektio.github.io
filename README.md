## Scope of the Documentation

The documentation is intended to be a reference for the Arkitekt Platform and the basic concepts of Deploying
the Arkitekt Platform. As the Arkitekt Platform is a collection of tools and services, the documentation of this
project is focused on providing overarching documentation for integration these tools and services into the
whole Platform. If you are looking for documentation on a specific tool or service, please refer to the
documentation for that tool or service. You can find links to the documentation for each tool or service in
the Projects documentatoni [Arkitekt Platform](https://arkitekt.live/docs/developers/contribute/projects) section of the documentation.
